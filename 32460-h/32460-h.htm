<h2>The Boy Scouts for Uncle Sam</h2>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3>THE EAGLES AT HOME.</h3>


<p>"After all, fellows, it's good to be back home
again."</p>

<p>The speaker, Rob Blake, leader of the Eagle
Patrol of Boy Scouts, spoke with conviction. He
was a "rangy," sun-burned lad of about eighteen,
clear-eyed, confident and wiry. His Boy
Scout training, too, had made him resourceful
beyond his years.</p>

<p>"Yes, and it's also good to know that we each
have a good substantial sum of money in the
bank as the result of the finding of the Dangerfield
fortune," agreed Merritt Crawford, his second<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
in command, a sunny-faced, good-natured
looking youth a little younger than Rob and
crowned with a tousled mass of wavy brown
hair.</p>

<p>"Well, at any rate we've had plenty to eat since
we've been back," chimed in Tubby Hopkins, a
corpulent youth who owed his nickname to his
fleshiness.</p>

<p>"That's right, Tubby," laughed Paul Perkins,
another bright-eyed young "Eagle"; "that's
something we didn't always get in the Adirondacks.
I thought at one time that you'd fade
away to a shadow."</p>

<p>"Humph! Pretty substantial sort of shadow,"
grinned Hiram Nelson, who, besides Paul Perkins,
was the inventive genius of the Eagles.</p>

<p>The scene of these reminiscences was the comfortably
furnished patrol room of the Eagles,
situated over the bank of the little town of
Hampton on the south shore of Long Island.
Rob Blake's father, the president of the bank,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
was a patron of the Eagles, and had donated the
room to the boys some time before.</p>

<p>Boxing gloves, foils, baseball bats and other
athletic apparatus dear to a boy's heart lay scattered
about the room in orderly confusion. On
the walls were diagrams of the "wig-wag code"
and the "Morse code simplified," with other illustrations
of Scout activities.</p>

<p>But it was above the door that there was
perched the particular pride of the Eagles' hearts&mdash;a
huge American eagle, a bird fast disappearing
from its native haunts. With outstretched
wings and defiant attitude it stood there, typifying
the spirit of its young namesakes. The eagle
had been a present to the lads from Lieutenant
Duvall, of the United States Army, whom they
had materially aided some time before in various
aerial intrigues and adventures. What these
were was related in full in the "The Boy Scouts
and the Army Airship."</p>

<p>In the first volume of this series, "The Boy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
Scouts of the Eagle Patrol," it was told how the
boys came to organize, and how they succeeded
in unravelling a kidnapping mystery, involving
one of their number. In the second volume,
"The Boy Scouts on the Range," we followed the
boys' adventures in the far southwest. Here they
encountered Moqui Indians and renegade cow-punchers.
But through all their hardships and
adventures they conducted themselves according
to the Scout laws.</p>

<p>The third volume was "The Boy Scouts and
the Army Airship," referred to in connection
with Lieutenant Duvall. In this book a military
biplane played an important part, as did the theft
of a series of plans of a gyroscope invention of
Lieutenant Duvall's, who was an all-around mechanical
genius.</p>

<p>In the story that preceded the present account
of the Eagle Patrol the lads found themselves
in the Adirondacks on a strange mission. With
a certain Major Dangerfield, a retired army officer,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
they searched for a lost cave in which an
old-time pirate, one of the Major's ancestors, had
hidden his loot when Indians threatened him.
How the cave was located and the startling discovery
made there, we have not space to describe
here. But in the wildest part of the "land of
woods and lakes" the boys encountered some
thrilling adventures, not the least of which was
Rob's battle with the moonshining gang that infested
a lonely canyon.</p>

<p>From this trip they had returned not more than
two weeks before the scene in the meeting-room,
which we have described, took place. Bronzed,
clear-eyed and alert, they were already longing
for action of some sort. How soon they were to
be plunged into adventures of a variety even
more exciting than any they had yet encountered
they little dreamed at the moment.<br /><br /><br /></p>



<p>They were still laughing over the idea of the
substantial Tubby's rotund form being compared<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
to a shadow when there came a tap at the door
of the room in which they were assembled.</p>

<p>"Guess that's Andy Bowles," said Rob, referring
to the only member of the Patrol who was
not present; "wonder why he's so late."</p>

<p>Then, in a louder voice, he cried:</p>

<p>"Come in, Andy."</p>

<p>But the voice that answered as the door was
flung open was not Andy's. Instead, it was a
deep, resounding bass one.</p>

<p>"I'm not Andy; but I'll accept the invitation."</p>

<p>As the owner of the voice, a tall, well-set-up
man with a military bearing, stepped into the
room all the Scouts sprang erect at attention, and
gave the Scout salute. Then they broke into
three cheers.</p>

<p>"Why, Lieutenant Duvall, what are you doing
here?" exclaimed Rob, coming forward.</p>

<p>The young officer shook hands warmly with
the leader of the Boy Scouts. Then, while the
others pressed closer to the lieutenant&mdash;the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
officer who had conducted the aviation tests at
the "tunnelled house"&mdash;he addressed Rob.</p>

<p>"The fact is, I came down here to see if you
are willing to tackle some more adventures," he
said.</p>

<p>"Are we&mdash;" began Rob; but a roar from the
Scouts interrupted him.</p>

<p>"Just you try us, Lieutenant."</p>

<p>"More adventures? Great stuff!"</p>

<p>"I'm ready right now."</p>

<p>"You can count on me."</p>

<p>The air fairly bubbled with confusion and excitement.</p>

<p>The Lieutenant roared with laughter.</p>

<p>"I do believe if you boys were told to lead a
forlorn hope up to a row of machine guns you'd
do it," he exclaimed; "but all this time I've been
leaving my friend outside. May I bring him in?"</p>

<p>"Why ask the question?" exclaimed Rob.
"This room is at the disposal of the United States
Army at any time."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, in this case it must be at the disposal
of the Navy also," smiled the officer. Then,
turning his head, he called to someone outside in
the hallway, "Dan, the Eagles are prepared to
receive the Navy."</p>

<p>At the word, a stalwart young man of about
Lieutenant Duvall's age, stepped into the room.
He was deeply sun-burned, and had an alert, upright
carriage that stamped him as belonging to
Uncle Sam's service.</p>

<p>"Scouts of the Eagle Patrol," said Lieutenant
Duvall, with becoming formality, "allow me to
present to you Ensign Daniel Hargreaves, of the
United States Navy, just now detailed on special
service."</p>

<p>Once more came the Scout salute, and then,
given with a will, the long drawn "Kr-e-e-ee"
of the Eagles.</p>

<p>The naval officer's eyes twinkled.</p>

<p>"These are Eagles that can scream with a
vengeance," he exclaimed to his companion.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes; and they can show their talons on occasion,
I can assure you," declared Lieutenant
Duvall. "But 'heave ahead,' as you say in the
Navy, Dan, and put your proposition before
them."</p>

<p>The boys greeted this announcement with
wide-open eyes. Somehow or other they felt impressed
immediately that they were on the verge
of another series of important adventures; that
the unexpected visit of the officers had something
to do with their immediate future. And in this
they were not the least bit out of the way, as
will be seen.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>THE FACE AT THE TRANSOM.</h3>


<p>"Of course what I am going to say will be held
strictly confidential?" began Ensign Hargreaves,
looking about him at the bright, eager faces of
the young Eagles.</p>

<p>"We are Boy Scouts, sir," responded Rob
proudly.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon; but what I am going to
say is so important to the nation that one word
of it breathed abroad might cause endless complications
and the ruin of certain plans. I have
come to see you because my friend, Lieutenant
Duvall, told me that he did not know anywhere
in the country of a band of boys of similar resourcefulness,
courage and high training."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's going some," whispered Tubby,
behind a plump hand, to Merritt Crawford.</p>

<p>"I said no more than they deserved, Dan," observed
Lieutenant Duvall.</p>

<p>"So I should imagine from what you told me
about the part they played in the matter of the
biplane and the tunnelled house," responded the
young officer. "I came to you for another reason,
also," he went on reverting to the subject in
hand; "I have heard that as well as being land
scouts you are thoroughly at home on the
water."</p>

<p>"Well," said Rob, "we've all of us been
brought up here on the south shore. I guess we
are all fair sailors and know something about
sea-scouting as well as the land variety."</p>

<p>"It is mainly for that reason that I came to
you," rejoined the naval officer. "For the mission
which I am desirous to have you undertake
a knowledge of sea conditions is essential."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>"Gee! He's a long time coming to the point,"
mumbled Tubby impatiently.</p>

<p>"Have any of you boys ever heard of the
'Peacemaker submarine'?"</p>

<p>"So called because the nation possessing it
would be so formidable as to insure naval peace
with other countries?" exclaimed Rob quickly.
"Yes, sir, I've heard of it."</p>

<p>"What has reached your ears about it?"</p>

<p>"Why, a week ago the papers said that a submarine
of that type had been sold to Russia and
shipped for that country from the factory of the
inventor at Bridgeport, Connecticut," said Rob,
with growing wonder as to what all this could be
leading.</p>

<p>"Correct. But that submarine never reached
Russia!"</p>

<p>"Did the ship that was carrying it sink?"
asked Tubby innocently.</p>

<p>"No," smiled the ensign, amused at the fat
boy's goggling eyes and intent expression; "the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
<i>Long Island</i>, the freighter conveying it, did not
sink. Instead, it hung about the coast, and then,
under cover of fog, slipped into the harbor of
Snug Haven on the South Carolina coast. Snug
Haven is a small place and a sleepy one. Under
the blanket of fog the <i>Long Island</i> slipped in, as
I have said. Then the submarine was hoisted
overboard by means of a derrick, and under her
own power run to anchorage off a small island
not far from Snug Haven. The captain and
crew of the <i>Long Island</i> were sworn to secrecy,
and so far as we know not a soul, but those directly
interested, is aware of the present location
of the <i>Peacemaker</i>."</p>

<p>"But why, if the submarine was sold to Russia,
was she not sent there?" inquired the mystified
Rob.</p>

<p>"For the excellent reason that she was <i>not</i>
sold to Russia at all," was the naval officer's rejoinder;
"that was simply announced for the
benefit of inquisitive newspapers who have been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
trying for a long time to get at the details of
the 'Peacemaker submarine.' But it is not alone
the newspapers we have had trouble with. Foreign
spies, anxious to secure the <i>Peacemaker</i>
for their governments, have harassed us
at Bridgeport ever since the keel plates were
laid."</p>

<p>"Then the United States has bought the
submarine?" asked Merritt Crawford.</p>

<p>"Not yet. But the construction and principles
of it are so efficient that Uncle Sam wishes to
have first call on the craft."</p>

<p>"And you are going to test it at this lonely
island in South Carolina?" cried Rob, guessing
the truth.</p>

<p>"Perfectly right, my boy," was the response.
"Off that little-frequented coast, beset with islands
and shoals, we hope to carry out our tests
unobserved. At Bridgeport this would have
been an impossibility, and for that reason the
story of the sale to Russia was concocted. Russia,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
I may add, was about the only country not
represented by spy service at Bridgeport."</p>

<p>"And you say that nobody but the officials directly
connected with the craft has any knowledge
of its whereabouts?" asked Rob with deep
interest.</p>

<p>"As far as it is humanly possible to be certain,
such is our positive belief."</p>

<p>"But where do we fit into all this?" sputtered
Tubby, acutely coming to the main point.</p>

<p>"I am coming to that," was the response.
"From what I have told you, you will have gathered
that no ordinary class of watchmen could
be trusted to keep quiet about what is to go forward
on the island. Yet it is necessary to have
sentries of some sort to keep constant watch that
no one approaches unexpectedly. For that purpose
we have adopted various mechanical precautions,
such as submarine detector bells, etc. But
our main reliance must be on human intelligence."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>"I see," said Rob, nodding. The object
of the officer's visit was beginning to dawn on
him.</p>

<p>"To come straight to the point," went on the
officer, "how would you boys like to take a camping
trip to the South Carolina coast on Uncle
Sam's service?"</p>

<p>"You mean to act as guards to the submarine?"
almost shouted Rob.</p>

<p>"Just that," responded the officer. "I
have&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But a roar of cheers drowned any further remarks
he might have had to make.</p>

<p>"I knew it would happen," cried Merritt when
the riot had, in a measure, subsided.</p>

<p>"What?" demanded Tubby.</p>

<p>"Action!" responded Merritt briefly.</p>

<p>The hubbub grew tumultuous. All the Eagles
were trying to talk at once. The wonderful prospect
opened up before them of fresh adventures
fairly set them wild.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>At last, above the turmoil, Ensign Hargreaves
managed to make his voice heard.</p>

<p>"Boys! Boys!" he exclaimed, "one minute till
I outline the plans."</p>

<p>A respectful silence at once ensued in which
each Scout was prompt to join.</p>

<p>"Of course, it will be necessary for you to obtain
written consent of your parents," spoke the
naval officer.</p>

<p>At this some of the faces in the room fell several
degrees.</p>

<p>"The government will absolutely require such
authority," he continued. "The service on Barren
Island, as it is called, while not necessarily
hazardous, may prove dangerous, and each boy's
parents must be so informed."</p>

<p>"We'll get plenty to eat, I suppose?" inquired
Tubby anxiously.</p>

<p>"Why, of course," laughed the officer; "moreover,
I forgot to inform you that there is a wireless<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
plant on the Island, and other conveniences
unusual in so remote a situation."</p>

<p>"Well, so long as the grub holds out, I'm satisfied,"
muttered Tubby in a contented tone.</p>

<p>"How soon will we start, supposing our parents
allow us to go?" asked Rob, as soon as
the laughter over Tubby's remark had subsided.</p>

<p>"At the end of this week if possible. Mr. Danbury
Barr, the inventor of the <i>Peacemaker</i>, will
meet us in New York. We shall voyage south on
the U. S. Derelict Destroyer <i>Seneca</i>."</p>

<p>"Derelict Destroyer," repeated Rob. "Those
are the craft that Uncle Sam sends out to destroy
drifting wrecks that might prove a menace
to navigation, aren't they?"</p>

<p>"Correct, my boy," rejoined the officer. "Our
reason for making the voyage on the <i>Seneca</i>,"
he continued, "is that no regular passenger
steamer makes a stop near Barren Island.
Furthermore, if we went down on a naval vessel
some of these sharp reporters would be sure to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
make inquiries, with the result that our retreat
might be discovered."</p>

<p>"And that would be a serious matter?" put in
Rob.</p>

<p>"Yes, very serious. Several nations are on
the <i>qui vive</i> to discover just what the <i>Barr Peacemaker</i>
is. They have sent shrewd, cunning men,
versed in the art of espionage, to this country on
that mission. These men will stick at nothing to
ferret out the secret if they can. Mr. Barr has
been approached with all sorts of offers. But
he is a staunch American to the backbone, as you
will discover when you meet him. If anyone is
to have the <i>Peacemaker</i> it is to be Uncle Sam,
first, foremost and all the time."</p>

<p>"Kree-e-ee-ee!" shrilled the Boy Scouts of the
Eagle Patrol in unison.</p>

<p>The sharp, screaming note of the Eagle was
still resounding when Merritt uttered a startled
cry, and pointed to the open transom above the
door. The others were still staring at him when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
he darted toward it and flung the portal open.
The passage beyond was empty, and the boy
turned to his companions with a puzzled look on
his face.</p>

<p>"What's up, Merritt?" asked Rob.</p>

<p>"Seeing spooks?" inquired Tubby.</p>

<p>"Seeing nothing," snapped out Merritt; "I
<i>saw</i>&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Saw what?" demanded Lieutenant Duvall.</p>

<p>"A face peering at us over that transom. It
dodged into the darkness as I looked up, but I
saw it as plain as daylight."</p>

<p>Both officers bent forward almost breathlessly.
Merritt's communication appeared to affect them
strangely.</p>

<p>"What kind of a face was it?" demanded Ensign
Hargreaves.</p>

<p>"A wild looking one. Very pale, and fringed
with dark whiskers."</p>

<p>The effect on the officers was electrical. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
both sprang up and made for the door followed
by the puzzled Scouts.</p>

<p>"Was&mdash;was it anyone you know?" demanded
Rob, as he paced beside Lieutenant Duvall.</p>

<p>"Yes. From the description it was Berghoff,
the spy of a powerful European nation whose
ambition it is to outgeneral all other powers on
the sea. We must apprehend him if possible. It
is only too clear that he followed us here from
Washington and must have heard a great part of
our conversation."</p>

<p>"Phew! This is action with a capital A!"
gasped Rob as they ran down the stairway and
out into the lighted street.</p>

<p>But although a rigorous search was made and
all trains watched, no trace was found of Nordstrom
Berghoff, the naval spy. It was surmised
that he must have made good his escape in a
speedy "roadster" car in which he had crept into
Hampton earlier in the evening.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>AN OCEAN DERELICT.</h3>


<p>"What's that object off on the starboard bow,
sir?"</p>

<p>It was a week after the events narrated in the
preceding chapters, and the <i>Seneca</i>, a converted
gun-boat fitted with torpedo tubes for the destruction
of derelicts, was plowing her way
southward through an azure sea under a cloudless
sky.</p>

<p>Rob Blake asked the question. In full Boy
Scout Leader's uniform, and wearing the different
badges to which he was entitled, the young
chief of the Eagles stood on the <i>Seneca's</i> bridge
with Ensign Hargreaves and Lieutenant Murray,
who were in command of the destroyer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>"Jove, lad, you have sharp eyes!" exclaimed
Lieutenant Murray. "Even the lookout has not
yet spied it. Let's see what it may be. Possibly
it's our 'meat'&mdash;food for our torpedoes."</p>

<p>"In that case the boys are in for a bit of excitement,"
said Ensign Hargreaves.</p>

<p>"You think it is a derelict!" exclaimed Rob.
"Oh, boys!" he called down to the shady deck
below, where the other lads lay reading or writing
letters or studying the Scout Manual, "we've
sighted a derelict."</p>

<p>"An ocean hobo, eh?" hailed back Merritt.</p>

<p>"Hold on! Hold on! Not so fast!" laughed
Lieutenant Murray.</p>

<p>He took his powerful naval binoculars from
their case and carefully focussed them on the dot
which Rob's sharp eyes had espied at so great a
distance.</p>

<p>"You are right, Master Rob," he exclaimed the
next instant; "it <i>is</i> a derelict, and a big one, too."</p>

<p>"And you are going to blow it up?" asked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Rob, his voice quivering with excitement.</p>

<p>"That's our business, lad."</p>

<p>"Hooray! Boys, stand by for the fireworks!"
shouted the delighted Rob.</p>

<p>The Boy Scouts, who had pretty well the run
of the ship and were favored alike by officers
and men, came swarming upon the bridge.
Lieutenant Murray was adjusting the range
finders and directing the quartermaster at the
wheel to change his course so as to bear down on
the drifting hulk. As they drew closer to the
dismantled derelict they saw that, as Lieutenant
Murray had declared, she had been a large vessel.
Stumps of three masts rose from her decks above
the broken bulwarks. Ends of bleached and
frayed-out shrouds hung from her fore, main,
and mizzen chains. From the look of her, she
had been a considerable time adrift.</p>

<p>As she rolled slowly on the gentle swell they
could see that her underbody was green with seaweed
and slime, the accumulation of years.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Amidships stood a small deck house, and at the
bow a broken bowsprit pointed heavenward as if
invoking mercy on her forlorn condition.</p>

<p>"Why, she might have been drifting about
since the time of Noah, to judge by her looks,"
exclaimed Merritt, gazing at the odd sight.</p>

<p>"I have heard of derelicts that have followed
the ocean currents for fifty years and more," declared
the Lieutenant. "This craft looks as if
she might date back that far. Certainly she has
been a long time adrift. Sailors sometimes become
panic-stricken and leave their ships when
there is no real necessity for so doing. A case in
point is that of Captain Larsen of the <i>Two Sisters</i>,
which sailed from Bath, Maine, for a West
Indian port. She was abandoned in a hurry after
a hurricane, and the captain and crew took to the
boats. After drifting for weeks&mdash;they had had
time to provision the boats well&mdash;they arrived in
Kingston, Jamaica, and the first sight that
greeted the captain's eyes was the hulk of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
<i>Two Sisters</i>. She had drifted close to the island
and had been towed in, arriving ahead of the
crew that had forsaken her!"</p>

<p>"Hark!" cried Merritt, while they were still
commenting on the Lieutenant's story, "what
was that?"</p>

<p>"Sounded like a bell tolling," exclaimed Rob.</p>

<p>"It is a bell!" cried Merritt.</p>

<p>Sure enough, borne over the gently heaving
water, there came to their ears the melancholy
ding-dong of a deep-toned bell. Coming as it
did from the abandoned sea-riven hulk it cast a
gloom over them.</p>

<p>"Who can be ringing it?" cried Tubby, in
what was for him, an awe-stricken voice.</p>

<p>"No mystery about it, I guess," said Lieutenant
Murray; "it is the ship's bell, and as the craft
rolls it is ringing a requiem for the dead."</p>

<p>"Ugh! It gives me the shudders!" exclaimed
Hiram.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's not a cheerful sound certainly," agreed
Rob.</p>

<p>"Bom-boom; bom-boom," chimed the bell,
waxing now faint, now loud, as the wind rose
and fell.</p>

<p>"I'd like to go aboard that boat and explore
her," declared Merritt.</p>

<p>"That's an opportunity you shall have," said
the Lieutenant. "It is our rule to explore all
such derelicts for a hint as to the fate of their
crew before we consign them to the deep."</p>

<p>Orders were given to check the speed of the
<i>Seneca</i> and to prepare to lower a boat.</p>

<p>"Are we to go?" chorused the Scouts eagerly.</p>

<p>"Of course. Mr. Hargreaves will accompany
you."</p>

<p>"Aren't you going?" asked Rob.</p>

<p>"No. It's an old story with me. While we
are waiting for you, I will work out our position,
which must go in with my report of the derelict's
destruction."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>Five minutes later, in one of the <i>Seneca's</i>
whale boats, the boys were skimming over the sea
toward the melancholy old derelict. As they
glided along, the bell kept up its monotonous
booming with the regularity of a shore bell summoning
worshippers to church.</p>

<p>As the whaleboat was pulled around the derelict's
stern they could see a name painted on the
square counter, surrounded with many a scroll
and flourish in the antique manner. These flourishes
had once been gilded and painted, but the
gilt and color had long since worn off them.</p>

<p>"<i>Good Hope of Portland, Me.</i>," read out Rob.
"What a contrast between her name and her
fate!"</p>

<p>"Bom-boom," tolled the bell as if in answer to
him.</p>

<p>"She must have been one of those old-time
clippers that sailed round the Horn with Yankee
notions for the Spice Islands and China, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
came back with tea and other Oriental goods,"
opined Ensign Hargreaves.</p>

<p>"She was a fine ship in her day, sir," ventured
the old quartermaster who pulled stroke oar.</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, Tarbox; in those days the American
mercantile marine was a thing to be proud
of," agreed the ensign. "To-day not one-tenth
of the craft that used to fly the Stars and Stripes
remain afloat. They have vanished and their
keels sweep the sea no more."</p>

<p>By this time they had arrived below the derelict's
port main chains. From these several
bleached ropes hung down, but all proved too
rotten to support the weight of a Boy Scout, let
alone a man. But by good fortune a chain, rusty,
but still strong seemingly, depended from the
bows of the old craft. This withstood a test, and,
led by Ensign Hargreaves, the boys clambered
on deck. Quartermaster Tarbox and the four
sailors who had manned the oars were left in the
boat.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>The boys' hearts beat a little faster as they
stood on the forecastle of the abandoned <i>Good
Hope</i>. Nor was this caused by the exertion of
the climb altogether. There was something uncanny
in standing upon that long-untrodden
deck, while right below the break in the forecastle
the bell kept up its doomsday-like tolling.</p>

<p>The ensign's first task was to make fast a lanyard
to the clapper of the dismal thing, and
thereafter their nerves felt steadier. With the
dying out of the clamor of the bell, a death-like
hush fell over the abandoned ship. Only the
rippling complaint of the water as she rolled to
and fro broke the stillness. The boys actually
found themselves talking in whispers under the
spell that hung above the decks of the ill-fated
<i>Good Hope</i>.</p>

<p>"Let us explore that deck house first," said
Ensign Hargreaves, and, followed by the boys,
he started for the small structure which stood
just aft of the wreck of the foremast.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>Little dreaming of the surprise that awaited
them within, the boys followed, on tip-toe with
curiosity and excitement.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>A MYSTERY OF THE SEA.</h3>


<p>The door of the deck house was closed. But
the ensign opened it without difficulty, and with
the boys pressing close on his heels he entered
the place.</p>

<p>Hardly had he done so before he fell back
with a sharp exclamation. The next instant the
boys echoed his interjection with a tone in which
horror mingled with surprise. Seated at a table
in the cabin was what at first appeared to be a
man. But a second glance showed that, in
reality, the figure was a grim skeleton upheld by
its posture and still bearing mildewed and mouldy
sea clothes.</p>

<p>"What a dreadful sight!" cried Rob, shivering,
although the day was hot.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>"Poor fellow!" exclaimed the naval officer.
"He must have perished just as he sat. See,
there is a paper under his hand, and there lies
the pen with which he had been writing."</p>

<p>He stepped forward to make a further examination,
and the boys, mastering their instinctive
dread of the uncanny scene, also approached
the table.</p>

<p>The writing beneath the dead man's hand was
on a fragment of paper, yellowed with age and
covered with scrawlings grown brown from the
same cause. Mastering his repugnance, the ensign
took the paper from under the skeleton's
fingers that still rested upon it.</p>

<p>"What is it?" demanded Rob.</p>

<p>"Look at it for yourself," returned the officer
after scrutinizing the document.</p>

<p>Thus addressed, Rob took the mouldy screed
while his chums looked over his shoulder curiously.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, it's nothing but a mass of figures," he
exclaimed.</p>

<p>"That is certainly so. Some sort of cipher, I
suppose," struck in Merritt.</p>

<p>"That's what it is, I imagine," agreed the ensign;
"but see this cross marked in red ink in the
midst of the figures! What can that be intended
for?"</p>

<p>"If you don't mind, I'll try to figure this out
sometime," said Rob. "I'm rather fond of working
cryptograms and such things. It will serve
to pass the time, too, when we reach the Island."</p>

<p>"That is perfectly agreeable to me," returned
the officer. "If you can make anything of it, it
may serve to solve the mystery of this ship. For
that a mystery there is about the whole thing, I
feel certain."</p>

<p>"It does seem uncanny, somehow," agreed
Rob; "the posture of this man, this strange writing!
I wonder how he died?"</p>

<p>"Impossible to say," rejoined the officer; "but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
let us investigate further. We may make some
more discoveries."</p>

<p>"I hope we don't make any more finds of this
character," rejoined Rob with deep feeling.</p>

<p>Reverently and quietly they made their way
out of the presence of the dead mariner.</p>

<p>Their next objective point was the poop of the
vessel, where a high, old-fashioned quarter-deck
upreared itself above the main deck. Port holes
looked out from this, and the party of explorers
rightly judged that here had been the living-quarters
of the ship's officers. A door of heavily
carved mahogany gave access to the space below
the lofty poop-deck. Pressing through this, they
found themselves in a dark, dingy-looking cuddy.
The cushions of the lockers, which ranged along
each side, were green with mould and in the air
hung the odor of decay.</p>

<p>A skylight above gave light to this chamber,
and at its sides four doors, two to a side, opened
off.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>"Those doors must lead to the staterooms of
the former officers," declared the ensign, and a
tour of inspection of the rooms was begun at
once. In the first three, after a thorough ransacking
nothing more interesting was to be
found than some old sea chests, containing garments
and nautical instruments of antique pattern.
In the last, however, which bore traces of
having been better furnished than the others,
there hung a crudely painted picture of a grizzled-looking
seaman, on whose breast hung conspicuously
a gold image of a whale. Apparently
this was some sort of an emblem. But to Rob
the portrait presented a clew.</p>

<p>"Why, that same emblem hung on the uniform
of the dead man in the deckhouse!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"So it did," cried the ensign. "Boys, from
the looks of it, this was the cabin of the master
of the ship, and yonder body, it is my firm belief,
is his."</p>

<p>But Merritt had stumbled upon another discovery.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
This was nothing more than a large
book, bound in leather. But to the ensign it
seemed to be apparently a highly important find.</p>

<p>"It's the ship's log-book," he exclaimed, pointing
to the embossed words on the cover. "Now
perhaps we may light on a partial solution of this
mystery."</p>

<p>He opened the book at the first page, and
learned from the crabbed writing with which
it was covered, that the <i>Good Hope</i>, Ezekial T.
Daniels, master, had set sail from New Bedford
for the South Pacific whaling ground in
April, 1879.</p>

<p>"Gracious, that was about thirty-three years
ago," stammered Merritt.</p>

<p>"I have heard of derelicts that drifted longer
than that," said the naval officer calmly.</p>

<p>He began turning over the leaves of the
log book. It was an epic of the sea. Every
incident that had befallen the <i>Good Hope</i> on
her long voyage was faithfully set down. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
skimmed through the records, reading the most
interesting bits of information out aloud for the
benefit of his youthful companions.</p>

<p>From the log book it was learned that the <i>Good
Hope</i> had met with indifferent luck on her long
three years' cruise, but had suddenly run into
a most extraordinary bit of good fortune.</p>

<p>"Listen to this, boys," exclaimed the ensign
with what, for one of his self-contained nature,
was strong excitement, "it reads like a bit of
wild romance."</p>

<p>Without further preface he began reading:</p>

<p>"'May, 1883&mdash;This day encountered the strangest
thing in all my experience. As set down,
we have drifted into the Antarctic ice pack. This
day sighted a berg within which was a dark,
shadowy object. On going in the ship boats to
investigate we saw to our amazement that the
said object was a ship. The ice surrounding
it was thin, mostly having melted.</p>

<p>"'From what I knew of such craft I decided,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
incredible as the idea might seem, that the craft
within the berg was a long frozen up Viking
ship. Not knowing just what her recovery might
mean, I undertook to blast her free of her
prison. We had plenty of dynamite on board
for the very purpose of ice-blasting. By three
of this p. m. we had the ship blasted open. I
and my officers at once entered the hole the explosive
had made in the craft's side. We expected
to find strange things, but none of us
was prepared for what followed. The hold of the
imprisoned ship was full of ivory.</p>

<p>"'My first officer, William Clydesdale, an
Englishman, and a college man before strong
drink ruined him, pronounced the ivory to be that
of the tusks of the extinct mammoths which
scientists say formerly inhabited these regions.'"</p>

<p>"Phew! This is romance with a vengeance!"
exclaimed Rob.</p>

<p>"Did they get the ivory?" asked the practical
Paul Perkins.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," rejoined the officer, rapidly skimming
over the further pages of the log, "and they estimated
the stuff roughly at about five hundred
thousand dollars' worth of exceptional quality."</p>

<p>"How did the ship get frozen in the ice?"
asked Hiram. "The Viking ship, I mean."</p>

<p>"Who can tell," returned the ensign. "I have
heard of such things at the North Pole. Several
explorers have even brought back fragments
of the Norseman's lost craft; but I never heard
of such an occurrence transpiring in the Antarctic
regions. But let's read on."</p>

<p>The log continued to tell of hardships encountered
in beating back around the Horn with the
valuable cargo; of discontent of the crew; of
their constant demand to have the hoard divided
equally among the officers and men, and of the
captain's refusal to accede to their requests.
Finally the entries began to grow short and disconnected,
as if whoever was writing up the log<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
was on constant watch and had little time to
spare. Indeed, one entry read:</p>

<p>"Mutiny threatens constantly. The men mean
to seize the ivory and take to the boats."</p>

<p>Following that no entries were made for several
days. Then came a startling announcement,
both in its brevity and suggestiveness of tragedy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>A MESSAGE FROM THE PAST</h3>


<p>"'What I dreaded has come to pass,'" read
out the ensign; "'the men mutinied, but thanks
be to Providence, we are safe. But a fearful
catastrophe overtook the misguided fellows.
Short handed as we were, having lost ten hands
by scurvy and drowning in the South Seas, the
crew mustered but eight men. Thus, with my
two officers, we were three against them. The
attack came at midnight on July 27th, 1883.
Luckily we were on the watch, and as the men
came aft we met them with firearms. Four went
down at the first volley. Three died shortly, the
other the next day.</p>

<p>"'The remainder fled, but before I could stop<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
them my officers had shot down three, leaving
only the cook alive. I saved his life. But as we
were examining the injured, one of them whipped
out a knife and killed my first officer. The next
day we buried the dead and worked the ship as
best we could with three hands. Luckily the
breeze was light, for in a brisk blow we could
not have handled the ship.</p>

<p>"'Finding ourselves off the coast of the Carolinas,
and despairing of navigating the ship to
port, we ran in and anchored off a small desolate
island. On it grew a few scrub trees, but
not much else. After a consultation we decided
to abandon the ship; but first we agreed, while
the weather was fair, to bury the ivory on one of
the islands. It was a long, tedious task, but
at last it was done, and the spot where it had
been secreted, marked.</p>

<p>"'This done, we rowed back to the ship to
obtain my chronometers, papers, and so forth.
I should have explained that we had but one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
boat, heavy seas off the Horn having smashed
four of them, and a fifth was broken in a fight
with a whale. I was some time below, getting
papers, when suddenly I heard a splash of oars.
By some inspiration, I guessed what had happened.
Rushing on deck I was in time to behold
my rascally second mate and the cook rowing
from the ship with might and main.</p>

<p>"'I shouted, entreated, and raged. But it was
all in vain. All the rascals did was to laugh at
me. I might have guessed their terrible purpose
to maroon me on my own ship, but I had paid no
heed to some whispering I had observed between
them while on the island working at the burial
of the ivory. All this has been written since
they abandoned me in so cowardly a fashion for
the sake of the ivory. Their intent, I readily
guessed. They would reach the shore ahead of
me. Find some capital, get a ship and seize the
whole cache. I count myself lucky that they did
not kill me outright.'"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>By this time the boys were leaning forward,
all else forgotten in the thrilling interest of the
extraordinary narrative.</p>

<p>The ensign read on.</p>

<p>"I find no more entries till several days later,"
he said, "then comes this one:</p>

<p>"'Since last I wrote I have encountered a fearful
experience. The night succeeding the occasion
on which the two villains left the ship, a
terrific gale came up off shore. Unable to reef
sail single-handed, I was compelled to cut the
cable and head out for sea. For three days we
scudded before the gale. The canvas was torn
to ribbons, and one after another my masts went.
I managed to cut the wreckage free with an
axe.</p>

<div class='center'><big><b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</b></big></div>

<p>"'Some days later. What is happening to the
ship? She is being drawn by some strong but invisible
current. There is no wind, but she is
moving fairly fast. What can be going to happen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
to me? One thing is sure, I am out of the
track of ocean vessels. Heaven help me, for I
fear I am beyond human aid!'"</p>

<p>"The poor fellow's mind evidently gave way
soon after this," said the ensign; "the entries
grow disjointed and wild. He declares the cabin
is haunted. That the ghosts of the dead mutineers
haunt the ship. At last they cease abruptly
with the words, 'God be merciful to me, I am
going mad.'"</p>

<p>A silence fell over the party in the dead
mariner's cabin. The mystery, the spell of the
horror of it all, was strong upon them. In each
lad's mind was a vivid picture of the unfortunate
captain held in the grip of a strange current,
being driven day by day further from the
track of ships, while his fevered mind pictured
ghostly forms all about him.</p>

<p>"How do you suppose his death came?" asked
Rob, after the silence had endured some moments.</p>

<p>"I have an ugly suspicion which I shall soon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
verify," said the ensign; "you boys wait here for
a time."</p>

<p>Alone he re&euml;ntered the deck-house, where sat
the dead seaman. When he returned his face
was very grave.</p>

<p>"Boys, my suspicions were correct," he said;
"by the man's side I found a pistol. Undoubtedly,
crazed by despair, he ended his life."</p>

<p>"After writing this strange paper?" asked
Rob.</p>

<p>"Evidently. To judge from the jumble of
figures, it was the product of his poor, demented
brain."</p>

<p>"If you don't mind, I'll keep it, though," said
Rob. "I've an idea about it."</p>

<p>"In what way?"</p>

<p>"Why, that it may not be what you think, after
all. It bears the earmarks of an orderly cipher
and is not scrawled at all as are the final entries
in the log book."</p>

<p>"That's right," agreed the ensign admiringly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
"you Boy Scouts have mighty keen minds. Well,
my boy, keep it and study it at your leisure, although
I am free to confess that I cannot think
of it otherwise than in the way mentioned."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are right," said Rob, "but I'll
have a try at puzzling it out, when I get time."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>A STARTLING ADVENTURE.</h3>


<p>During the conversation recorded none of the
party had given much thought to conditions outside.
Now, when he stepped to the door of the
cabin, the ensign uttered a sharp cry of consternation.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked Rob, as he approached.</p>

<p>"Matter enough. Look there!" was the rejoinder.</p>

<p>A dense white fog had come softly rolling up,
and now the derelict <i>Good Hope</i> lay enwrapped
in fleecy white clouds, thick and impenetrable.</p>

<p>"Well, we'll have to wait here in the boat till
this clears off," declared Bob; "we could never
find the <i>Seneca</i> in this mess."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's the worst of it," rejoined the lieutenant,
"there is no boat."</p>

<p>"No boat," echoed Rob uncomprehendingly;
"but we came in one. It will be waiting for us."</p>

<p>"No. I gave orders for the men to return to
the <i>Seneca</i> and bring over a destructive mine, for
I had determined to blow up this dangerous menace
to navigation. They have not returned, that
is evident, or I would have been notified. Boys,
we are in a bad fix. I don't know how fast this
old hulk is drifting; but I imagine that if this
keeps up much longer, we shall fetch up a long
way from the <i>Seneca's</i> whereabouts."</p>

<p>"Can't they cruise about and find us?" asked
Merritt rather piteously. He was not a lad to
underestimate the real seriousness of their position
on board the old hulk in the impenetrable
fog that hung in blanket-like wreaths everywhere
about them.</p>

<p>In reply to the boy's question the ensign declared
that it would be impossible for the <i>Seneca</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
to pick them up until the weather cleared,
if then.</p>

<p>"It would be risking the vessel to cruise about
in this smother," he said; "why, she'd be as likely
to strike the <i>Good Hope</i> as not!"</p>

<p>Rob's face grew long, though he did his best
to make light of the situation.</p>

<p>"Then we've got to picnic here till the fog
clears off," he said.</p>

<p>"That's the case exactly, Rob," was the officer's
rejoinder.</p>

<p>"But what are we going to picnic on?" inquired
Tubby anxiously. "There's no food or
water on board, and we haven't brought any."</p>

<p>"There you go again. Always thinking of
that precious tummy of yours," cried Hiram.
"A little starving won't hurt you."</p>

<p>"Huh, just because you look like a human bean
pole, you don't think anyone has a right to be fat.
You're jealous, that's what you are," was the
indignant reply of the fat youth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>Under other conditions there might have ensued
a rough and tumble battle; but just at this
instant, through the fog, there came the booming
sound of a vessel's whistle.</p>

<p>"Waugh-gh-gh-gh!"</p>

<p>The long bellow sounded through the white,
all-enveloping mist surrounding the old hulk and
its young company of castaways.</p>

<p>"That's the <i>Seneca's</i> whistle," exclaimed the
ensign anxiously. "She's calling for us."</p>

<p>"Gee! She must know that we can't come to
her," exclaimed Paul Perkins.</p>

<p>"I guess she's 'standing by' till the fog lifts,"
rejoined the officer. "We'll release the bell.
That may help to locate us."</p>

<p>But instead of standing by, it became apparent,
before long, that the <i>Seneca</i> was cruising about.
The reason for supposing this was that the next
time they heard the hoot of the siren it sounded
much further off.</p>

<p>The boys exchanged glances.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>"How long do these fogs last, as a rule?" enquired
Merritt.</p>

<p>"Impossible to say!" was the quick reply, with
an anxious look about. "If only we could get
a slant of wind!"</p>

<p>But there was not a breath stirring. Only the
<i>Good Hope</i> swung to the soft swells, lifting and
falling with a hopeless, helpless sort of motion.
In fact, an experienced seaman could have told
her waterlogged condition by the very "heft and
heave" of her, which was sluggish to a degree.</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose we must make up our minds
to spend some time here," said Rob, with another
attempt to treat the matter lightly. "Goodness,
our adventures are surely beginning early this
trip!"</p>

<p>The others could not help but agree with the
young leader of the Eagles, although they could
hardly foresee the still more thrilling experiences
that lay just ahead of them.</p>

<p>"I would suggest," began the ensign presently,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
"I would suggest that we search for some trace
of food."</p>

<p>"Humph; mouldy ship's biscuits!" grunted
Tubby half under his breath. "Even if there
are any on board, they must be rotten by this
time. This is a fine fix! Maybe we won't get
any supper at all," and the fat boy looked positively
tragic over the dire prospect.</p>

<p>But although Tubby had spoken in a low tone,
more to himself than to anybody else, the ensign's
sharp ears had overheard him.</p>

<p>"Young man," he said somewhat sternly, "if
you want to be a good Boy Scout you must learn
to take hardships as they come."</p>

<p>"Even missing meals?" asked Tubby, in an injured
voice.</p>

<p>"Yes, even that," repeated the young officer
with a smile, which in the Eagles' case was a
perfect roar of laughter at Tubby's keen distress.
The fat boy strode off sullenly by himself, gazing
at the fog as he went in a very knowing way.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>They searched the ship over for something
that it would be possible to eat; but not so much
as a crumb of edible supplies did they find. In
one hold was discovered a number of barrels of
"salt horse and pork," but they were all dried
up and unfit for human food. The same thing
applied to the biscuit kegs, and all the other supplies.
It was out of the question to think of
touching any of them.</p>

<p>"Whatever are we going to do?" gasped Rob,
a note of real alarm in his voice for the first
time.</p>

<p>The ensign's calmness served to steady all the
boys a bit.</p>

<p>"Don't worry; everything will come out all
right," he said; "we are in the track of ships,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But in this dense fog, that fact make it all
the more dangerous," declared Rob, and the
young officer could not but answer him with a
nod in the affirmative.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>"I can't help admitting that, my boy," was
his further rejoinder; "all we can do is to trust
to Providence and hope that the fog will disappear
before long."</p>

<p>"Let's whistle for a wind," suggested Rob,
who had heard of sailors doing such a thing.</p>

<p>"Better than doing nothing. It will fill the
time in, anyway," agreed the ensign.</p>

<p>The boys squatted in a circle.</p>

<p>"What will we whistle?" asked Merritt.</p>

<p>"'Wait Till the Clouds Roll By,' of course,"
rejoined Rob.</p>

<p>As the plaintive notes came from the whistlers'
puckered lips, Tubby sauntered up, his hands in
his tunic pockets.</p>

<p>"What are you doing?" he asked, staring at
them, "gone crazy with the heat, or what?"</p>

<p>"We're whistling for a wind," answered Merritt.</p>

<p>"Huh; why don't you whistle for grub?" demanded
Tubby, turning on his heel, and striding
gloomily off once more.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>TRAPPED BY FLAMES.</h3>


<p>Night fell and found them still in the same
plight. The fog had shut in closer if anything.
Since the last time they had caught the diminishing
sound of the <i>Seneca's</i> siren, they had
heard no sound from any vessel. Others besides
Tubby were hungry on board the <i>Good
Hope</i> that night. Then, too, the thought of the
tragedy that had been consummated on board the
derelict, and the gloom-inspiring presence of the
silent figure in the forward deck house, were not
calculated to inspire cheerful thoughts.</p>

<p>One thing they did have, and that was light.
For in the course of their investigation of the
old hulk they had stumbled across several old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
candle lanterns, the candles in which were still
capable of burning. One of these lanterns was
lashed to the stump of the forward mast, but the
other was hung up in the cabin below. For it was
in this latter place that the little party of castaways
gathered and tried, by telling stories and
cracking jokes, to keep their spirits in the ascendent.</p>

<p>But their efforts were not very successful. As
the Scotch say, "It's ill jesting on an empty
stomach," and that is the malady from which they
all were suffering. Thirst did not as yet trouble
them much, but they knew that if they were not
speedily picked up by some vessel, that would also
be added to their ordeal.</p>

<p>So the night passed away, with the castaways
watching in turn for some ray of hope of the
fog lifting. It was soon after midnight, and in
Rob's watch, that a startling thing happened&mdash;something
that brought his heart into his mouths,
and set his every nerve on vibrant edge.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>The boy was sitting up forward, pondering
the strangeness of the day's happenings, when
suddenly, right ahead of him, as it seemed, the
fog was split by the hoarse shriek of a steamer's
whistle.</p>

<p>Rob's scalp tightened from alarm as he leaped
for the lantern.</p>

<p>"Look out!" he shouted at the top of his voice;
"look out!"</p>

<p>But for reply there only came back out of the
dense smother ahead another raucous call of the
big steam whistle.</p>

<p>"Gracious! We'll be run down! We'll be
sunk!" cried the boy, half wild with alarm.</p>

<p>He shouted to his companions to come on deck;
but before they could obey, a huge, black bulk
loomed up right above the derelict. Rob shouted
at the top of his voice. It seemed as if the
<i>Good Hope</i> would be cut in two and that the
steamer was also doomed to disaster if she struck.</p>

<p>Through the blackness flashed a green side-light,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
and then came the rushing by of the great
hull, with its rows of illuminated portholes. Rob
stood stock still. He was fairly rooted to the
spot with panic. But the big steamer raced by
in the blackness and fog without anyone on board
her ever dreaming that she had been in such close
proximity to the drifting derelict.</p>

<p>As her stern lights flashed for an instant and
then were shut out in the fog, Rob's companions
came rushing on deck.</p>

<p>"What is it? What has happened?" demanded
the ensign, readily perceiving that something
very serious had occurred.</p>

<p>Rob, still shaky from his experience, related,
as briefly as possible, just what had caused his
cry of alarm.</p>

<p>"Well, those liners take desperate chances,"
commented the officer; "had they struck us, not
only we, but they, would have been seriously injured."</p>

<p>"Gee! I wish you could have found time to
ask 'em to throw us some sandwiches," said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
Tubby, rubbing his stomach; "I'm as empty as a
dry gourd."</p>

<p>"I reckon we could all do with something to
eat," chorused the other young "Eagles".</p>

<p>The ensign bade them cheer up.</p>

<p>"By daylight we may have a wind, and then,
with the fog gone, it won't take long for some
vessel to pick us up."</p>

<p>He spoke with a cheerfulness he was actually
far from feeling. In fact, his boyish listeners
were not inclined to look hopefully on the situation.
By this time every one of them would
have given almost all he possessed for a big
pitcher of cool ice water.</p>

<p>"I will take the remainder of your watch,
Rob," said the ensign, with a glance at his
watch. "You only had a few minutes to serve
anyway, and the next round of duty is mine."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Rob; "to tell the truth, a
nap would feel pretty good. I hope things will
have cleared by the time I wake up."</p>

<p>The boys went below, leaving the officer on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
fog-circled deck. The mist gleamed on everything,
the rays of the candle-lamp making them
glisten as if water had been newly poured on
them. Far off the hoarse hooting of the ship
that had so nearly run them down was to be
heard.</p>

<p>"Narrow escape, that! Narrower than I quite
care to admit, even to myself," mused the young
officer. "I wonder if those lads realize how bad
a fix we are in. I must confess I don't like the
look of things at all."</p>

<p>He fell to pacing the deck, and then decided
to have a cigar. For this purpose he produced a
perfecto from his pocket and lighted it. Then
he fell to pacing the deck once more, thinking
deeply. His cigar finished, he tossed it aside.
Possibly it was his worry over their predicament
that made him absent-minded in this regard, but
instead of observing the rule of the sea to cast all
such things overboard, he threw it to the deck.
A lurch of the <i>Good Hope</i> caused the glowing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
butt of the cigar to go rolling across the deck and
to drop into the hold below.</p>

<p>It was some time later that Paul Perkins came
on deck to take his turn at the night vigil.</p>

<p>As he came forward he was startled to see
what appeared to be a ghostly figure, slightly
darker than the fog, slip from the forward hold
and glide across the deck toward the ensign,
who was pacing up and down. Much startled,
Paul called out aloud, and at the same instant
a peculiar acrid odor came to his nostrils.</p>

<p>"Something's burning!" he cried.</p>

<p>Simultaneously he had come up to the side of
the hatch and saw that smoke was pouring from
it. What he had taken for a ghostly figure was
a whirl of smoke.</p>

<p>"Fire! Something's on fire below!" cried the
boy, dashing forward.</p>

<p>The ensign reached the edge of the hold as
quickly. Together they peered over into the
great open space below. Both involuntarily recoiled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
with a cry of horror and alarm at what
they saw.</p>

<p>The <i>Good Hope's</i> hold was a mass of flames!
To gaze into them was like looking into a red
hot furnace.</p>

<p>Adrift in a blinding fog, on a burning ship,
and without boats, was a predicament the like
of which their adventurous lives had never before
encountered!</p>

<p>The cigar so carelessly cast aside by the ensign
had fallen upon a pile of sacking, grease-soaked
and inflammable, lying in the former whaler's
hold. Like all whale ships the timbers of the
<i>Good Hope</i> were literally soaked with grease,
the result of whale oil and blubber. Such timbers
burn like matchwood.</p>

<p>Small wonder that, brave man as he was, and
schooled against emotional display in the stern
school of the Navy, the ensign should yet cry out:</p>

<p>"If help does not arrive, we are doomed to die
like rats!"</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3>A BOY SCOUT SIGNAL.</h3>


<p>It was five minutes later that the whole company
of castaways was gathered around the
hatchway. A red glare from below shone on
their faces, illuminating expressions of dismay
and apprehension.</p>

<p>"What can we do?" gasped out Rob. "There
are no boats, no means of escape!"</p>

<p>"We'll be burned to death," shuddered Paul
Perkins.</p>

<p>All looked to the ensign for some suggestion.
His tightly compressed lips and drawn features
suggested that he was thinking deeply, thinking
as men think whose very lives depend upon quick
decision.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>"We must put on the hatches," he said decisively;
"there they lie yonder. That will deprive
the fire of oxygen and give us at least a few
hours before we have to vacate."</p>

<p>The coverings of the hatch, big, thick planks,
lay not far away. Evidently they lay just as they
did on the day that the cargo of mammoth tusks
had been taken from the <i>Good Hope</i> and hidden.
Working with feverish energy, the boys soon had
the hatch covered tightly. But the work had
almost exhausted their strength. The fumes of
the blazing hold and the suffocating black smoke
that rolled out, had almost caused them to succumb.</p>

<p>Their desperate task accomplished, they lay
panting on the deck, incapable, for the time
being, of further effort. However, with the
hatch in place and tightly dovetailed, there was
a gleam of hope that the flames might be
smothered, or at least held in check till the fog
cleared and they could sight a vessel.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>The first faint glimmering of dawn, shown by
an increasing transparence in the fog, found the
derelict still lying inert. But a second later the
boys were on their feet with a cheer. A light
breeze had sprung up and the fog was agitated
by it like drifting steam. Little by little the
breeze increased and the fog thinned out to mere
wisps. The sun shone through and disclosed
a glimmering expanse of sea stretched all about.
But, to their bitter disappointment, the great
heaving expanse was empty of life. Not a sail
or a sign of a steamer marred its lonely surface.</p>

<p>They exchanged dismayed looks. There was
no knowing at what moment the fiery, seething
furnace beneath their very feet might break
through and force them to fight for their existence.</p>

<p>Already the decks were hot. Aside from this,
however, so well did the hatch fit that not even
a wisp of smoke escaped. Except the extreme
heat, there was nothing to indicate that the interior<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
of the <i>Good Hope's</i> hull was a fiery furnace.</p>

<p>The hours wore on, the little company of castaways
dreading every moment that what they
feared might happen. Still no indication that
the fire was about to break through occurred.
But their sufferings from thirst were terrible.
One after another the Boy Scouts sank to the
decks in a sort of coma. Rob, Merritt, and the
ensign himself alone retained their strength.</p>

<p>"If some vessel doesn't appear before long
we are doomed."</p>

<p>It was Rob who spoke, and the mere fact that
the others were silent indicated plainly that they
shared his opinion.</p>

<p>Despite their sufferings and anxiety a bright
lookout was kept. It was Rob who electrified
them by a sudden shout:</p>

<p>"Look! Look out there to the north!"</p>

<p>"A sail!" shouted the ensign, springing to his
feet.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes. A steam yacht, rather! She's coming
this way, too!"</p>

<p>"That's what. But how can we signal her?
If she doesn't hurry she may be too late!"</p>

<p>"We can wave and shout!"</p>

<p>The ensign shook his head.</p>

<p>"She is too far off to see or hear us. Is there
no other way to attract her?"</p>

<p>A dozen plans were thought of and discarded.
Then Rob spoke:</p>

<p>"I've thought of a way, but it's a desperate
one."</p>

<p>"Never mind, what is it?"</p>

<p>"We will signal her in Boy Scout fashion.
Maybe there is someone on board who understands
it."</p>

<p>The others looked puzzled. Rob hastened to
explain.</p>

<p>"You all know the smoke column system of
signalling?"</p>

<p>"I see what you mean!" shouted Merritt.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
"You mean to send up two columns of smoke
meaning 'Help! We are lost!'"</p>

<p>Rob nodded.</p>

<p>"But how is that possible?" demanded the ensign,
with a puzzled inflection in his tones.
"We've got a whole ship full of smoke under
us, of course, but I don't see how we are going
to utilize it in the way you suggest."</p>

<p>"I've thought it out," declared Rob modestly.</p>

<p>He produced his heavy-bladed scouting knife.</p>

<p>"Merritt, you take your knife and we'll cut
two holes in the top of the hatch. That will
make two smoke columns, and if anyone on that
yacht is a Scout, they will come rushing at top
speed toward us!"</p>

<p>"Jove! You boys are resourceful, indeed!"
cried the ensign admiringly.</p>

<p>Without more ado the boys fell to work on
their task. They cut the holes about ten feet
apart. It was hard work, but they stuck to it
perseveringly, and at last, from the two holes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
two columns of black smoke spouted up. Luckily
for their plans the wind had, by this time, moderated
so much as to have fallen almost flat.</p>

<p>High into the heavens soared the two black
columns of smoke like two pillars of inky vapor.</p>

<p>Every eye watched the distant yacht anxiously.
For five minutes the anxiety was so intense that
no one spoke. The pitch of expectancy was
painful.</p>

<p>Then came a great cry.</p>

<p>"They've seen our signal!" shouted Rob.</p>

<p>"Yes; look, she's changing her course. Look
at the black smoke coming from her funnel.
She's making top speed to our rescue!" cried
Merritt.</p>

<p>"Let's hope that she won't be too late," murmured
the ensign under his breath, and then
aloud he cried:</p>

<p>"Three cheers for the Boy Scouts of the Eagle
Patrol!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h3>THE BOYS MEET A "WOLF."</h3>


<p>Faster and faster came the yacht. She was
a large white craft, with a yellow funnel and
two rakish-looking masts, with light spidery rigging.
Between her masts was suspended a parallel
sort of "antenn&aelig;," wires betokening that she
carried wireless. At her bow the foam creamed
up as she rushed through the water on her errand
of mercy.</p>

<p>With what anxiety those on the <i>Good Hope</i>
watched her, may be imagined. Their eyes fairly
burned as they regarded the race of their rescuers
against the fire which raged below them.
For the two holes cut by Rob and Merritt, while
they had had the good effect of attracting aid,
had also had a less gratifying result.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>Through them the air had been transmitted
to the flaming mass below, and flames were now
shooting up through them and enlarging the
openings every instant. The air grew so fearfully
hot that all were compelled to beat a retreat
to the extreme stern of the <i>Good Hope</i>.</p>

<p>Little was said as the yacht rounded up as
close to the burning ship as she dared, and
lowered a boat. By this time clouds of black
smoke, shot with livid flames, were shooting skyward
above the doomed craft. It was a fortunate
thing for the castaways that no wind was
stirring or this story might have had a different
termination.</p>

<p>The boat was manned by sailors in white duck
clothes and was guided by a lad wearing the
Boy Scout uniform. As soon as they saw this
the boys gave the cry of the Eagle Patrol. As
the long drawn "Kree-ee-ee!" died out, the boy
in the stern stood erect and gave the Scout salute.
Then followed a long-drawn, growling shout:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>"How-oo-oo-oo!"</p>

<p>"That's the cry of one of the Wolf Patrols!"
cried Merritt.</p>

<p>"Yes; and that boy is a Wolf," declared Rob.</p>

<p>"Well, at all events he comes in sheep's clothing,"
the ensign could not resist saying.</p>

<p>The next instant the boat was under the stern
and the rescued castaways were sliding down a
rope into it. Hardly a word was spoken while
this was going on; the work in hand was too important.</p>

<p>But hardly had they all found places before, in
an earnest voice, the ensign exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Pull for your lives, men; spare no time."</p>

<p>"Why, you are safe enough now," declared the
Wolf Scout.</p>

<p>"Far from it," declared the young officer
seriously, "the log book of that craft spoke of
dynamite on board. They used it to blast their
way out of the polar ice. I think&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A terrific concussion that threw them all from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
their seats interrupted him. Then came a blinding
flash, and this in turn was followed by an
explosion that seemed to shake the sea.</p>

<p>"Pull for your lives!" shouted the ensign to
the alarmed sailors.</p>

<p>Dazed as they were, they lost no time in doing
so, but even then fragments of blazing wood and
red-hot metal rained about them in a downpour
of great danger.</p>

<p>Luckily, however, none of the blazing fragments
struck the boat. As soon as they recovered
their faculties, the boys gazed back at the spot
where the <i>Good Hope</i> had last been seen. There
was not a trace of her. The dynamite had literally
blown the ill-fated whaler out of existence.
Only oily pools remained on the surface to show
the spot of her vanishing.</p>

<p>"I can easily see that you chaps have been
through some thrilling experiences," remarked
the Wolf boy, whose name proved to be Donald
Grant, attached to the Wolf Patrol of the 14th
New York City Troop.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>"We have, indeed," rejoined Rob, "but we
would rather defer the telling of them till we
arrive on board your yacht. What's her name?"</p>

<p>"The <i>Brigand</i>," was the reply; "we are on a
cruise through the West Indies."</p>

<p>"The <i>Brigand</i>," echoed the ensign. "Isn't that
J. P. Grant, the great financier's yacht?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he's my father," rejoined Donald
simply; "he's on board. You'll be glad to meet
him, and I know he'll be delighted to welcome you
and hear your story."</p>

<p>"Did you recognize our signal as soon as you
saw it?" inquired Rob.</p>

<p>"I sure did," responded Donald; "lucky you
sent it up, too, as we were on another course,
and would not have passed near enough to see
that there was anyone on board what we thought
was just an old hulk drifting about the ocean."</p>

<p>"You'll be more interested still when you hear
how we made the signals," spoke up Hiram.</p>

<p>"Well, I knew that the call meant that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
necessity was urgent, and although we were
going slowly at the time we soon got under full
speed. Dad has been a bit sceptical about scouting,
but I guess he'll admit there's some good in
it now."</p>

<p>"It was Scout lore that saved our lives," said
the ensign quietly.</p>

<p>"Not a doubt of that," agreed Donald; "but
here we are, almost alongside the <i>Brigand</i>."</p>

<p>The boys gazed up at the towering sides of
the big yacht, at her glittering brass work, and
crowds of white-jacketed sailors gazing over the
side curiously. Astern a big bronzed man leaned
over the rail gazing down with equal interest.
Rob recognized him instantly from pictures he
had seen of him in the papers, as Junius P.
Grant, the "Wall Street King," as he was called.</p>

<p>He greeted them with a wave of his hand.</p>

<p>"Welcome to the <i>Brigand</i>, young men," he
hailed in a hearty tone; "you have the Boy Scout
idea to thank for your lives. Had my lad there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
been five minutes later we'd have been too late
to save you."</p>

<p>"That's true enough, sir," hailed back the ensign;
"we all thank you from the bottom of our
hearts for your prompt relief work."</p>

<p>"The best thanks you can give me will be to
come on board at once and get washed up and
partake of the best the <i>Brigand</i> can provide,"
was the pleasant reply.</p>

<p>"Yes; get on board, quick," urged Donald, as
the gangway was lowered and the boatmen
shipped their oars, "you look about all in."</p>

<p>"We look like a lot of tramps, I guess you
mean," laughed Rob, but for all that he felt a
bit ashamed of their appearance. They were covered
with grime from their fire-fighting experiences.
Loss of sleep, hunger, and exposure had
drawn their cheeks and reddened their eyes.
Altogether, they looked very unlike the trim crew
that had set out from the Derelict Destroyer
<i>Seneca</i> only a comparatively short time before.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as they arrived on board, they were
turned over to the steward, who provided them
with quarters in which to spruce up. Everything
on the <i>Brigand</i> was appointed as luxuriously
as could be possible. This fact rather added
to the boys' embarrassment. But when half an
hour after their arrival they gathered about a
splendidly appointed luncheon table, their embarrassment
turned to positive bashfulness. Never
had any of them felt so out of place. The ensign
alone retained his self-possession.</p>

<p>It was not till Mr. Grant had tactfully interested
them in relating their adventures, that they
forgot their self-consciousness and ate and drank
during the narrative, like famished wolves&mdash;or
Eagles.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<h3>A NEW RECRUIT.</h3>


<p>It was about an hour after luncheon, which,
naturally enough, with all that had to be related,
had been a rather protracted meal. The party
of which the Boy Scouts and their naval friend
had so unexpectedly become members was foregathered
beneath the stern awning in comfortable
wicker chairs.</p>

<p>The ensign was relating to Mr. Grant, under
pledge of secrecy, some details of the work which
was expected to be accomplished on the lonely
island. Mr. Grant, who was intensely interested,
agreed to put the officer and his young charges
ashore at Charleston or some convenient port,
provided the <i>Seneca</i> could not be reached by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
wireless. The boys were secretly hoping that this
would prove impossible, that they might protract
their cruise on the <i>Brigand</i>.</p>

<p>Donald and the boys had instinctively become
chums. The millionaire's son was a manly, self-reliant
sort of chap, with crisp, curly hair, and
blue eyes that could be merry or determined.
Then, too, he was a first-class Scout and deeply
versed in Scout lore. In fact, the Eagles were
no more than a match for the knowledge of this
young Wolf.</p>

<p>While the ensign and Mr. Grant chatted, they
watched the youngsters with interest. When
Donald had carried them off to show them the
<i>Brigand</i> from stem to stern, as he expressed it,
Mr. Grant laid down his cigar and, turning to
the ensign, said, with his customary abruptness:</p>

<p>"Could you use another Boy Scout on this
work?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I&mdash;really, I've hardly considered it,"
was the astonished rejoinder.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>"If you could, I have one for you."</p>

<p>"You mean your son Donald?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He is a manly, fine lad, but he has been
a little bit coddled by his mother and sisters.
Now he and these other boys appear to get along
famously, and they are just the sort of lads I
should like my boy to associate with."</p>

<p>The naval officer nodded.</p>

<p>"I never saw or heard of such another lot of
lads as those comprising the Eagle Patrol," he
said with emphasis; "although, of course," he
continued, "there are probably many such enrolled
in the ranks of the Boy Scouts."</p>

<p>"I don't doubt it. Donald is a different lad
already since he joined the Wolf Patrol. Now
this cruise of mine will be dull at best to the lad.
You see I am combining business with pleasure,
and he will be thrown much on his own resources.
He has seen the West Indies before, so there
would not be much that is novel to him in the
scenery or the people. What do you say to my
proposal?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>Cigar in hand, the great man of Wall Street
paused for an answer, knitting his famous black
eyebrows as he did so.</p>

<p>"Why, if Donald is anxious to go, I don't see
why it could not be arranged," was the ensign's
reply; "but why not ask the lad himself?"</p>

<p>"And your boys, too, of course," was the rejoinder;
"they might object to adding an outsider
to their number."</p>

<p>"Not much fear of that," smiled the officer;
"why, you would think they had been lifelong
friends. Hark at that!"</p>

<p>A merry peal of laughter came ringing from
somewhere about the ship.</p>

<p>At this juncture, a young man in a natty uniform
came hastening up. He bore a slip of
yellow paper which he respectfully handed to
the Wall Street magnate.</p>

<p>"Ah, Collins,&mdash;Mr. Hargreaves, this is our
wireless operator."</p>

<p>The ensign nodded while Mr. Grant gazed over
the message.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>"So you picked her up, eh, Collins?" he said,
handing the message he had just perused over
to the ensign.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. It appears that after missing the
derelict in the fog the <i>Seneca</i> cruised in circles
looking for her. She is now within ten miles
of us."</p>

<p>"So I see by this message," struck in the ensign;
"we are fortunate not to have drifted
further."</p>

<p>"What do you wish to do?" inquired Mr.
Grant.</p>

<p>"Naturally, to be transferred to my own ship,
if you will be so kind."</p>

<p>Mr. Grant nodded.</p>

<p>"Collins, get our exact position from the captain,
signal it to the <i>Seneca</i>, and tell her we will
lay off and on here till she arrives."</p>

<p>"Very well, sir," said the man of the wireless,
with a bow.</p>

<p>He had hardly withdrawn when the boys<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
came up, fresh from their inspection of the
<i>Brigand</i>. All were loud in praise of the craft,
especially Rob and Merritt.</p>

<p>"Would you rather cruise on this craft or go
on the duty for Uncle Sam which lies before
you?" asked Mr. Grant quizzically.</p>

<p>The Boy Scouts drew themselves up.</p>

<p>"Why, sir, our duty to our country comes before
pleasure," declared Rob, acting as spokesman.
"Cruising about is all right, but we Boy
Scouts like to be doing something useful for
somebody else, but most of all for Uncle Sam."</p>

<p>Rob paused, rather alarmed at his temerity at
thus addressing one of the richest men in the
world.</p>

<p>"So you think I am wasting my time cruising,
eh?" said Mr. Grant amusedly glancing at the
upright, slender boy before him from under his
heavy brows.</p>

<p>It was impossible to tell whether he was displeased
or not. But Rob decided not to recede<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
from his position. He knew that the Boy Scouts
were supposed to be manly, self-reliant, and upright
under all conditions. So putting his fears
of offending the man before him aside, he spoke
up boldly:</p>

<p>"It's different for you, sir. Your life work
has raised your monument; but I think, and I
guess my Patrol agrees with me, that it is better
for boys to be on active duty and," he added,
his eyes flashing and his cheeks glowing, "especially
such service as we are now going on. It's&mdash;it's
glorious," he concluded breathlessly.</p>

<p>"I think you are quite right, my boy," was
the magnate's reply, a very different one from
the rejoinder Rob had dreaded.</p>

<p>"I hope you don't think me presumptuous or
impudent," replied Rob, "but you asked my
opinion, and you know, sir, we Boy Scouts must
always tell the truth. Perhaps it seems a poor
return after you saved our lives, to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Mr. Grant cut the boy short with a wave
of the hand.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nonsense, all I did was to stand by and
watch. If Donald had not understood those
smoke signals, you might not be on earth now.
But in return, I want to ask you to do something
for him."</p>

<p>Rob nodded respectfully but said nothing. He
wondered greatly what could be coming next.</p>

<p>"I want you to take Donald with you on this
duty for Uncle Sam. The ensign here has
agreed. Are you willing to make my son one of
your party?"</p>

<p>"Are we willing?" stammered out Rob. "Why,
sir, we've just been discussing what a shame it
was that he had to go on a stupid old cruise&mdash;I
beg your pardon, on a cruise&mdash;when real work
lay ahead, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Donald had danced up to his father cheering
and throwing his hat in the air. Then he
rushed up to his newly-found comrades and a
hand-shaking and "bear hugging" match ensued,
such as is rarely seen except among lads who are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
real companions, bound together by a common
bond.</p>

<p>Suddenly above the tumult Rob's voice
sounded.</p>

<p>"Boys, let's give the cry of the Wolf Patrol!"</p>

<p>Instantly savage growls resounded, and after
that the Eagles joined hands, formed a circle
about Donald, and danced a sort of war dance of
joy, concluding with the screaming cry of their
Patrol.</p>

<p>Mr. Grant and Ensign Hargreaves smilingly
watched this scene.</p>

<p>When something like order had been restored,
the latter announced the closeness of the <i>Seneca</i>.</p>

<p>This, too, was greeted with a cheer, which was
cut short by the reappearance of Collins.</p>

<p>"I've been talking with the <i>Seneca</i>, sir, and he
says that they are proceeding here at full speed."</p>

<p>"Good. That will do, unless you have any
communications to make," said Mr. Grant, turning
to the ensign.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, sir, none whatever," was the reply.</p>

<p>It was ten minutes later when Rob's sharp
eye descried a trail of smoke on the horizon. A
short time after, by the aid of glasses, the craft
was made out to be the <i>Seneca</i>, bound at full
speed for the yacht. On the latter's signal-halliards
up went a gaudy string of signal flags
announcing her identity. The signal was
answered from the Derelict Destroyer, which
also fired a gun in honor of the recovery of the
castaways.</p>

<p>By midafternoon good-byes, warm and hearty,
had been said, three ringing cheers exchanged
between the crews of both craft, and the <i>Brigand</i>
was headed due south, while the <i>Seneca</i> made in
toward the coast. Long before sunset both craft
had vanished from each other's sight.</p>

<p>"So that was one derelict that Uncle Sam did
not have to destroy," laughed Ensign Hargreaves
to Lieutenant Murray as they stood side by side
on the bridge.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," rejoined the other, "she committed suicide;
but if it hadn't been for our young recruit,
Donald, she wouldn't have gone to her grave
alone!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<h3>BARTON THE MACHINIST.</h3>


<p>An island, a sandy, scantily grown spot of
land, shaped like a splash of gravy on a plate,
loomed up over the <i>Seneca's</i> bow. On it stood a
shed, two naked masts with wireless antenn&aelig;
strung between them, and some tents, and that
was all, except that, removed from the shed mentioned
above, was a similar and larger structure.
This second structure was built on piles right
out over the sea, and as the coast of the island
declined abruptly at this point, there was considerable
water under its corrugated iron roof.</p>

<p>"So that's Barren Island?" asked Rob, who,
with the boys and the two officers, was standing
on the bridge of the <i>Seneca</i> regarding with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
most intense interest that desolate spot of land.</p>

<p>Beyond it lay other islands equally barren, so
that applicability of the name was not quite clear,
while in the dim distance a faint blue line betokened
the Carolina coast.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is Barren Island," nodded Lieutenant
Murray; "and strange as it may seem, the
hopes of the Naval Department are centered right
at this moment on that sandy patch yonder."</p>

<p>"Seems queer, doesn't it?" commented Merritt.</p>

<p>"Queer but safe," smiled Ensign Hargreaves.</p>

<p>"I'm aching to get ashore," exploded Donald
eagerly. "Is that a powerful wireless?"</p>

<p>"It is capable of sending up to three hundred
miles on an average, and more under favorable
conditions," was the reply.</p>

<p>"What's in that big shed?" demanded someone.</p>

<p>"That houses the <i>Peacemaker</i>. The shore
shelves off abruptly and the submarine is housed
under that roof in more than forty feet of water."</p>

<p>"And the other building?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>"A combination cook house and dining room."</p>

<p>"Shall we have lots to eat?" asked Tubby, his
eyes glistening as he heard.</p>

<p>"Plenty, I hope," rejoined the ensign smiling.
"There is an ample stock of provisions, and they
will be received from the mainland as occasion
requires."</p>

<p>"But how shall we reach the mainland?"</p>

<p>"In a powerful motor boat," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Say, this is going to be a regular picnic. I
thought you chaps said hard work lay ahead of
us," complained Donald.</p>

<p>"Don't worry," laughed Rob; "I guess we'll
find lots to do."</p>

<p>"Never fear," struck in the ensign. "Besides
the inventor of the <i>Peacemaker</i>, Mr. Danbury
Barr, and ourselves, there will be only three
trusted sailors, familiar with submarine work,
to conduct the tests; so you see that you boys
will have your time well occupied."</p>

<p>"Are those tents for us?" asked Paul Perkins
interestedly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, no. You brought your own camping
outfits with you. I shall sleep in one, Mr. Barr
in another, while the third will be occupied by the
sailor assistants."</p>

<p>"And they are already there?" asked Rob.</p>

<p>"Watch," smiled Lieutenant Murray.</p>

<p>He seized the whistle cord and blew three resounding
blasts.</p>

<p>Instantly, from the large shed referred to as
housing the submarine, four figures appeared,
three wore sailor garb and the fourth, it could
be seen, was in overalls and shirt sleeves.</p>

<p>They waved and the boys cheered.</p>

<p>"I guess we'll drop anchor right here and
take you ashore in a boat," said Lieutenant
Murray.</p>

<p>The necessary orders were given, the chain
roared out, and the <i>Seneca</i> swung at anchor off
Barren Island in twenty fathoms of water.</p>

<p>"Can we go down as deep as that in the <i>Peacemaker?</i>"
inquired Rob.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>"Deeper, much deeper," was the rejoinder;
"we hope to go deeper than any submarine has
ever been before."</p>

<p>"Whoof!" exclaimed Donald.</p>

<p>"What's the trouble?" inquired Merritt.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing; only it makes a fellow feel kind
of creepy, that's all," was the rejoinder.</p>

<p>No sooner had the anchor been dropped, than
a scene of great activity ensued. The wireless
operator of the <i>Seneca</i> was flashing signals back
and forth with the shore station, and sailors were
piling Boy Scout equipment into one of the boats
while another was lowered for the passengers.
Donald had his own outfit, it having been on
board the <i>Brigand</i> when he transferred to the
<i>Seneca</i>. Although he was the son of one of the
richest men in the world, it in no wise differed
from the other lads' outfits, except that it had
not seen such hard service as theirs had been
through.</p>

<p>At last all was ready, good-byes were said, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
not without some regret the Boy Scouts left their
kind friends of the <i>Seneca</i> behind. Ashore a
warm welcome greeted them. Mr. Danbury
Barr proved to be a tall, lean individual with a
prominent, thin-bridged nose, and sharp, gray
eyes with all the keenness of a hawk in them.
His skin was burned a deep golden brown by his
sojourn on the island while getting his craft in
readiness for the tests. Like most inventors he
had not much to say, but seemed to be agreeable
and glad to see the newcomers.</p>

<p>The three sailors, as became them in the presence
of an officer, stood respectfully back without
saying anything, only drawing up and saluting.
But this was not the case with a man who has
not yet been mentioned. This was an individual
named Luke Barton. He was Mr. Barr's expert
machinist and mechanical superintendent.
Rob took an instinctive dislike to the fellow. Not
that there was anything actually repulsive about
him. On the contrary, he was a well-set-up chap<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
of about thirty-five, dark haired and mustached;
but it was something shifty in the fellow's eyes
that made Rob distrust him. This impression
was not removed when he asked of Mr. Barr,
in a voice by no means an undertone:</p>

<p>"What's this parcel of kids doing here? Looks
like a Sunday school picnic."</p>

<p>Mr. Barr explained.</p>

<p>"Oh, a bunch of kid tin soldiers," he sneered,
and strode off swinging a big monkey wrench.
Right then and there Rob's instinctive dislike of
the man crystallized into a feeling of distrust.
He felt sure that the fellow had some reason to
resent the presence of the Boy Scouts.</p>

<p>Mr. Barr made no comment on his assistant's
remarks, doubtless not thinking that they had been
overheard. In fact, the rest of the party, except
Rob, had been standing at some little distance
when the fellow uttered his sneering jibes.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<h3>THE SUBMARINE ISLAND.</h3>


<p>Under Mr. Barr's guidance the party toured
the island. It was about half a mile across and
slightly longer than its width. Coarse grass
grew almost to the water's edge, and in the
centre, where it rose in a cone-shaped formation,
some stunted, wind-twisted bushes grew. Also
on the summit was a driven well, which was
formed of galvanized piping, and went down, so
the boys were informed, for more than two hundred
feet.</p>

<p>But to the lads of the Eagle Patrol the most
interesting thing on the island was, of course,
the shed that housed the submarine. This shed
was open at both ends, and under its iron roof<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
lay the submarine craft. Lying as it did, with
only its rounded back showing above the surface
of the water, it reminded the boys of a sleeping
whale.</p>

<p>On the top of it, amidships, was the conning
tower, with thick glass lenses for observation.
From the conning tower also protruded the periscope,
an instrument which enabled the operators
of the craft to see the ocean about them even
when submerged some twenty feet below the
surface.</p>

<p>A stout rail ran around the top of the hull so
as to allow the crew to walk along the slippery
decks without danger of going overboard. But
it was the interior that the boys were most
anxious to see, and a glad rush followed when
Mr. Barr invited them on board. Access to
the conning tower was gained by a gang plank
running from the side of the shed. Reaching
the conning tower, with a press of eager lads
about him, Mr. Barr threw open a metal door in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
the top of the observation post, and climbed inside.
The boys needed no invitation to follow
him.</p>

<p>Inside they found themselves in a compartment
much resembling the wheelhouse of an ordinary
surface craft, except that there were various
instruments to show submergence, and the quality
and pressure of the air, and devices for
handling the engines; for one of the features of
Mr. Barr's invention was that it could be handled
by one man once the engines were going.</p>

<p>Leaving the conning tower, they descended a
steel ladder into the heart of the submarine.
The centre was occupied by a comfortably fitted-up
room which contained, among other things,
a small library and a phonograph. The inventor
switched on a button and the "cabin," as it
may be called, was instantaneously flooded with
a soft light, bright but not glaring. In the bulkheads
at either end of this compartment were
doors, steel riveted and solid looking. The inventor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
explained that beyond the stern one were
located the engine room and crew's quarters,
while on the other side of the forward portal
lay the sleeping quarters, galley or kitchen, and
bathroom. Beyond these again came the torpedo
room, which contained the machinery for launching
the death-dealers. Each of these was inspected
in turn, the boys being delighted with
the compactness and neatness of everything.</p>

<p>"Now," said the inventor, "we will visit the
engine room." Paul Perkins and Hiram looked
interested; machinery was one of their hobbies.</p>

<p>The <i>Peacemaker</i> carried two sets of engines,
electrical for running under the surface, and
gasoline for use above water. The engines were
fitted tandem-wise, and to their shafts were attached
twin screws of a novel design that gave
great speed and controlled the submarine easily.
The gasoline engines were of fifteen hundred
horse-power each, and the electrical had a trifle
lower capacity.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>In the engine room, too, were the powerful
pumps used for emptying or filling the submarine's
submergence tanks as it was desired to
rise or descend. Aft of the engine room came
the gasoline tanks, the storage batteries, and
some minor machinery, such as an ice-making
plant, air compressor, and so on. In the engine
room, too, was a comfortable upholstered lounge
for the engineer on duty to rest upon. Several
dials and gauges were on the walls of this compartment,
enabling the engineer to know at all
times under just what conditions the submarine
was proceeding.</p>

<p>It was in the engines themselves that the inventor
had excelled all other types of submarines,
as well as in the peculiar attributes of the hull.
Extra tanks were provided whereby, in the event
of the main supply of gasoline giving out at any
time, the <i>Peacemaker</i> could be run quite a distance
on those alone.</p>

<p>"How long could you stay below the surface?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
asked Rob, as they came back into the main cabin
once more. There they took their seats on broad
leather divans which at night time could be converted
into beds or bunks by pulling a lever which
caused them to turn over and reveal a snug resting
place.</p>

<p>"I have not yet made an exhaustive test of
that," rejoined Mr. Barr, "but I estimate that
we could remain below, if necessary, forty-eight
hours."</p>

<p>"Forty-eight hours!" gasped Rob incredulously.</p>

<p>The inventor nodded calmly.</p>

<p>"My air purifying device makes this supposable.
I have a plan by which fresh, pure air is
almost manufactured. At the same time the foul
air is forced out."</p>

<p>"I suppose you boys are aching to take a trip,"
laughed Ensign Hargreaves.</p>

<p>"Aching is no word for it," Rob assured him.</p>

<p>"Well, you may have a chance to-morrow,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
said Mr. Barr; "I am going to test out the whole
craft thoroughly, and you boys can come along if
I go."</p>

<p>For the next five minutes nothing could be
heard but enthusiastic shouts. The boys fairly
went wild with delight at the prospect of a trip
below the ocean's surface. Soon afterward the
party emerged from the submarine in time to see
the <i>Seneca</i> making out to sea on her return
journey. She carried letters from the boys to
their families, as they were by no means sure
when they would get the next opportunity of
sending a letter north.</p>

<p>The next hour was occupied in making camp.
Then the Stars and Stripes and the Eagle banner
went up. Donald had no Wolf banner with
him, but above his tent he hung up something
that resembled a wolf's head, painted on a bit of
canvas.</p>

<p>"Looks more like a chicken than a wolf,"
scornfully sniffed Tubby when he saw it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>"You couldn't think of anything but something
good to eat, could you?" was Donald's
crushing reply.</p>

<p>By the time camp had been made and everything
placed neatly in order, Andy Bowles, on
Ensign Hargreaves' order, sounded the dinner
call.</p>

<p>"That's the call that Tubby never forgets,"
laughed Rob, as the stout lad cantered off in the
direction of the combination dining hall and cook
house above mentioned.</p>

<p>They found a bare, pine table, scrubbed
scrupulously clean and set with metal plates and
cups. Lieutenant Hargreaves showed each boy
to his seat, while he and the inventor sat at
opposite ends of the board. The sailors, and the
machinist who had impressed Rob so unfavorably,
ate later.</p>

<p>The cook, a stout, good-natured looking negro,
came bustling in with a huge bucket-like pan full
of steaming soup. Tubby's eyes glistened as he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
saw it, and soon he was piling in prodigious
quantities of it. The soup was followed by salt
beef, potatoes, and other vegetables, and then
came a big wedge of cocoanut pie.</p>

<p>"We get fresh meat fairly often," explained
Mr. Barr, "but the launch has not been to the
mainland recently, so we have to get along on
what sailors call 'Willie'."</p>

<p>"Isn't there game of any kind hereabouts?"
asked Rob.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. There are several shore birds of
different varieties, but we have really been too
busy of late to go after them. Now that you
boys have come, however, you can take out my
shot guns&mdash;I have three of them&mdash;and see what
you can do as hunters."</p>

<p>"Are the shore birds good eating?" inquired
Tubby with his mouth full of pie.</p>

<p>"Yes, Master Hopkins. Epicures, in fact, declare
that there is no better dish than roasted
plovers."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll take one of the guns," declared Tubby,
his eyes glistening, as, even his appetite satisfied
for the while, he sank back in his chair.</p>

<p>As they filed out of the dining hall the negro
cook announced to the sailors and the mechanic,
by means of a big bell, that it was time for them
to eat.</p>

<p>Rob, on his way to the camp, happened to pass
by Luke Barton. He greeted the latter with a
cheery nod.</p>

<p>"Going to eat, Barton?" he inquired.</p>

<p>The man glowered at him a minute, and then
muttering something about "fresh kids eating up
everything," he strode on toward the eating
place.</p>

<p>"My gracious," exclaimed Tubby, who had
witnessed the whole proceeding, "you and that
fellow get along like a pair of panthers, don't
you?"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<h3>DOWN TO THE DEPTHS.</h3>


<p>It was the following morning, a bright, clear
day, with a clean swept sky overhead, and seaward,
the waves whipping up into smart little
whitecaps under a brisk breeze. Breakfast was
over, the Boy Scouts' bugle had sounded an assembly
call, and now all were eagerly mustered
about the submarine shed awaiting Mr. Barr's
arrival and permission to go on board the <i>Peacemaker</i>.</p>

<p>True to his promise, the inventor had decided
to make the boys participants in the trial trip of
the slate-colored diving boat. Presently he appeared,
accompanied by Ensign Hargreaves.
Ten minutes later the chatting, laughing party<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
was on board the <i>Peacemaker</i>, and half an hour
after that she was pronounced ready for the
start. Mr. Barr took his place in the conning
tower with Ensign Hargreaves beside him.
Barton was in the engine room, sullen and uncommunicative
as usual. Rob and Merritt were
on deck with one of the sailors, delegated to the
duty of casting off the diving boat's lines.</p>

<p>At last came the word from the conning tower:</p>

<p>"Cast off."</p>

<p>Rob seized a rope and cast off from the stern
bitts, while the sailor performed the same operation
at the bow.</p>

<p>"Must we come inside now?" inquired Rob,
through the open hatch of the conning tower.</p>

<p>"Not yet; unless you wish to. I will notify you
before we dive," was Mr. Barr's reply.</p>

<p>"Goodness, I hope he doesn't forget," said Rob
laughingly, as the inventor turned on a switch
and started the engines. The cigar-shaped form
of the craft trembled as the powerful twin propellers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
beat the water. Then, handling as perfectly
as a catboat, she backed slowly out of the
shed and on to the open sea.</p>

<p>Once outside the shed, her helmsman headed
the craft about and made directly east. To Rob
and Merritt, standing on the deck, the sensation
was a thrilling one. Faster and faster the craft
was driven till great clouds of spray compelled
the two lads to seek refuge in the conning tower.</p>

<p>Inside the boat the hum of machinery and the
vibration of the powerful engines could be plainly
distinguished. Rob glanced at the speed indicator
on the steel wall of the "pilot house."</p>

<p>"Twenty-five knots! Phew! that's going
some," he gasped.</p>

<p>"She can make thirty-two on the surface and
twenty-one under water," said the inventor
calmly.</p>

<p>As he spoke, he drew a lever toward him and
the <i>Peacemaker</i> appeared to leap forward like
a horse under the lash.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>Rob watched the handle of the indicator as it
sped slowly around the dial. Up and up it crept
till it stopped at thirty-two knots and a half.</p>

<p>"Jove! Barr," exclaimed the ensign, "this is
the wonder craft of the century."</p>

<p>"I think I could get even more speed out of
her, but I don't wish to strain the engines," was
the confident reply.</p>

<p>"This is fast enough for me, thank you," said
Rob to Merritt in an undertone.</p>

<p>From the conning tower lens the <i>Peacemaker</i>
appeared to be rushing between two solid walls
of water, so great was the quantity of spray she
threw as she was remorselessly driven through
the choppy sea. Yet the vibration was not nearly
as bad as might have been expected.</p>

<p>"Let's go below and take a look at the engine
room," said Merritt.</p>

<p>"All right; but I'll ask Mr. Barr's permission
first," was Rob's rejoinder.</p>

<p>This was readily obtained, and the two boys<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
went below. They found their comrades gathered
in the large central cabin, excitedly discussing
the novelty of their voyage. Passing them,
the young leader and his lieutenant made their
way back into the machinery department. Barton
glowered at them as they entered.</p>

<p>"Well, what d'ye want?" he asked gruffly.</p>

<p>"Merely to have a look at the engines," said
Rob.</p>

<p>"Aw, what do you know about engines?"
growled the man. "You ain't got no business in
here."</p>

<p>"We have Mr. Barr's permission," rejoined
Rob in a calm, even tone, determined not to let
the fellow make him angry.</p>

<p>"Well, take a look around and get out quick,"
was the ungracious reply of the surly fellow.</p>

<p>Rob thought it best not to answer him, and
arm in arm he and Merritt wandered among the
flashing, smoothly working machinery, which,
despite its size and power, was almost noiseless.
Whatever his failings might be in the way of politeness,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
Barton must have been a good engineer,
the boys decided, for every bit of metal and paintwork
about the engines was polished to a brilliant
finish, and the engine room was as neat as
a new pin.</p>

<p>Rob was examining the powerful pumps when
his eye suddenly fell on a bit of paper lying on
the floor. He picked it up, prompted by he knew
not what instinct, and found that it was covered
with minute sketches, apparently of machinery.
The sketches were numbered and lettered, as if
they had been "keyed" for the purpose of making
the diagram clearer.</p>

<p>He was still examining the sketches when
there was a swift step behind him and a heavy
hand fell on his shoulder. Rob, facing about,
looked into Barton's face. The engineer's countenance
was livid, his eyes fairly blazed.</p>

<p>"Give me that paper, you young jackanapes!"
he exclaimed, "and then get out of here&mdash;quick!"</p>

<p>"As to giving you the paper, here you are,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
said Rob, quietly handing the engineer the mechanical
sketches. "If I'd known they were
yours, I'd have returned them to you at once.
I must ask you, however, to be a little less rough
in your manners. I don't know what harm
we've ever done you, that you should show such
a dislike for us."</p>

<p>"Bah!" growled Barton as he turned away,
thrusting the paper into a pocket of his jumper.</p>

<p>After this incident neither of the boys cared to
remain in the engine room, and soon joined their
companions in the main cabin.</p>

<p>They found them chatting and laughing over
different boyish topics, and Merritt joined in the
fun.</p>

<p>But Rob, usually talkative and bright, was
strangely silent. He found himself musing over
the incident of the scrap of paper covered with
mechanical sketches. Why had Barton become
so agitated when the boy picked it up? What
was there about the affair to excite the man so
strangely?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly into the boy's mind there flashed a
startling suspicion. But so grave was the idea
that he dismissed it, or rather tried to; but with
all his efforts the idea kept recurring like a dominant
note in a piece of music. Rob decided to
be on the watch and try to verify or disprove his
suspicion, which was nothing more nor less than
an idea that Barton was a traitor to his employer,
and was also in the service of some powerful interests
striving to get a grip on the secrets of
the <i>Peacemaker</i>.</p>

<p>"That man will bear watching," decided Rob.</p>

<p>Scarcely had he come to this conclusion when
Mr. Barr shouted down from the conning tower:</p>

<p>"I'm going to dive!"</p>

<p>The hearts of all the lads beat perceptibly
quicker at the words.</p>

<p>They were about to descend into the unknown
regions beneath the surface of the ocean, down
into the dark waters where men's souls are put
to a supreme test.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<h3>FACING DEATH.</h3>


<p>"Ready?" came the cry from the conning
tower.</p>

<p>"All ready!" shouted back the lads assembled
in the cabin, waiting for they knew not what.</p>

<p>"Then hold tight, we're going down quick."</p>

<p>S-w-ish-ish-ish! The roar of the water, as the
powerful pumps sucked it into the submerging
tanks, filled the interior of the Barr submarine.
Suddenly she gave a forward plunge, and the
boys now learned for what purpose several handholds
were attached to the cabin walls!</p>

<p>"Say, this is a queer sensation, isn't it?"
gasped Merritt, looking rather alarmed as the
downward rush could be distinctly felt. In the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
engine room the electric motors had been connected,
and in the conning tower the hatch which
gave entrance and egress when on the surface
had been clamped tightly down.</p>

<p>"S-s-pose we don't come up again?" exclaimed
Donald.</p>

<p>"We haven't got an awful lot to eat on board,"
murmured Tubby anxiously.</p>

<p>"Gracious, how far down are we going?"
spoke Merritt, as five minutes passed and still
the <i>Peacemaker</i> continued her descent into the
depths of the sea.</p>

<p>All at once the tilting motion ceased, the
<i>Peacemaker's</i> stern tanks were filled, and she
floated on an even keel. Leaving the care of the
wheel to Ensign Hargreaves, who, as we know,
was familiar with the usual type of submarine,
Mr. Barr came into the cabin.</p>

<p>"Well, boys, what do you think of it?" he
asked with a smile.</p>

<p>"It's g-g-great," rejoined Tubby, with a notable
lack of his usual assurance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>"And now I suppose you'd like to see what the
bottom of the sea looks like. We are down some
two hundred fathoms and about fifty miles off
the coast. Should you care to see how things
look down here?"</p>

<p>"How will that be possible?" asked Merritt.</p>

<p>By way of reply Mr. Barr went to the starboard
wall of the cabin and pulled a lever connecting
with a worm gear. As he did so, a great
section of the <i>Peacemaker's</i> steel side drew back
and revealed a plate glass window set between
the inner and outer "skins" of the craft.</p>

<p>The boys crowded round the window and
peered out eagerly. But to their disappointment
they could see no more of their surroundings
than if they had been looking out of a train window
on a dark night. It was as black as a wolfs
mouth at those unknown depths.</p>

<p>"Why, we can't see anything," came a disgruntled
chorus.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," smiled the inventor.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 365px;">
<img src="images/i003.jpg" width="365" height="450" alt="THE BOYS CROWDED ROUND THE WINDOW AND PEERED OUT EAGERLY." title="" />
<span class="caption">THE BOYS CROWDED ROUND THE WINDOW AND PEERED OUT EAGERLY.</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>Pressing a button, he extinguished the cabin
lights. Then he opened a sort of closet in the
wall alongside the window and swung out a
powerful, though small, searchlight attached to
an adaptable arm in the same manner as a desk
telephone.</p>

<p>There was a clicking sound, and a flood of
white light pierced the blackness outside. The
boys broke into delighted exclamations as the
powerful rays revealed all sorts of fish, many of
odd shapes and colors, attracted by the light.</p>

<p>Suddenly a dark, shadowy form swung into
view. Instantly the other fish vanished, and the
boys saw that the newcomer was a large shark
swimming leisurely along.</p>

<p>No doubt he wondered who the strangers in
his deep sea abode could be, for he swam up
close to the window, causing the boys to shrink
back. They quite forgot that between them and
the tiger of the deep was a solid plate of glass
as strong almost as steel.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>The shark gazed at the window for an instant
and then vanished. With its disappearance, the
other fish reappeared and kept the submarine
company, for all the world like sea gulls circling
round a ship entering port.</p>

<p>"I wonder if they are hungry and want us to
throw some food out to them," said Tubby
stolidly, as he gazed at the finny tribes darting
here and there in the searchlight's rays.</p>

<p>"Gracious, do you think that the fish have the
same appetite as you have?" laughed Merritt.</p>

<p>"Just the same, some of those fellows would
taste all right broiled," declared the stout youth,
at which there was a general laugh.</p>

<p>After an hour spent in this manner the searchlight
was switched off and the panels slid back
into place.</p>

<p>"I think we will rise now," said the inventor;
"you boys had better hold on, for we may go up
pretty quick."</p>

<p>"I hope we <i>do</i> go up," muttered Tubby, rather<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
nervously. The stout youth was not particularly
in love with the dark depths in which they were
navigating. In fact, all the lads, though they
did not admit it, experienced a longing for daylight.
It was an awe-inspiring feeling&mdash;too awe-inspiring
to be comfortable&mdash;to be in the depths
of the ocean where no keel had ever before
plowed.</p>

<p>Mr. Barr remounted to the conning tower. A
minute later a renewal of the swishing sound
told that the pumps were emptying the tanks at
the rate of a thousand gallons a minute. The
submarine could be felt to leap upward toward
the surface. The boys held on for dear life, exchanging
rather alarmed glances.</p>

<p>All at once the pace slackened, and the swishing
sound ceased. Mr. Barr had decided that the
pace was too swift and had cut off the pumps.</p>

<p>"Well, thank goodness that's over!" gasped
Donald. "At the rate we were going up we'd
have bounced clean out of the sea."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>"I guess we're all right now," remarked Merritt.</p>

<p>The words had hardly left his lips when there
came a jar and a bump that shook the submarine
in her every frame and rivet.</p>

<p>The boys were thrown from their feet and
hurled about the cabin. At the same instant the
engines stopped and the submarine began to
back, but slowly, like a stricken animal.</p>

<p>"We've rammed something!"</p>

<p>"We're sinking!"</p>

<p>These and a hundred other exclamations came
from the alarmed boys.</p>

<p>Mr. Barr poked his head down into the cabin.</p>

<p>"Are you all right below?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes; but what has happened?"</p>

<p>"Have we been badly damaged?"</p>

<p>"Are we sinking?"</p>

<p>The above questions were all shouted at once
in the tense excitement.</p>

<p>Barton, his face white as ashes, came out of
his engine room.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>"What did we hit?" he demanded in a frightened
voice.</p>

<p>"I don't know; but we struck something, possibly
a sunken wreck, a hard blow," was the inventor's
reply. Although his face was deadly
pale, his voice was without a tremor as he spoke.</p>

<p>"We must make an examination at once," he
went on. "Andrews, Higgins, and Ross," addressing
the three sailors who had appeared from
forward, "make an examination forward at once
and see if any of the plates have started. If you
find a suspicion of a leak report to me at once."</p>

<p>The sailors, trained in naval discipline, saluted,
and hastened off on their errand.</p>

<p>"If we are leaking, what are we to do?" demanded
Rob.</p>

<p>"Meet death as bravely as we can," was the
reply in steady tones; "submarines carry no boats
and we must go to the bottom unless we can find
some way to stop the leak."</p>

<p>Small wonder that the boys were stricken<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
aghast. Barton, the machinist, flung himself
face downward on a couch and began whimpering.</p>

<p>The inventor looked at the man with contempt.</p>

<p>"Stand by your engines, Barton," he commanded
sternly; "the first man to shirk his duty
in this emergency will have to settle with me."</p>

<p>Barton rose to his feet unsteadily. He was
pasty yellow with terror. In his eyes was a wild
look. But under the inventor's stern gaze he re&euml;ntered
the engine room, shaking like a leaf.</p>

<p>It was then that Rob noticed that a revolver
was in the inventor's hand as he stood at the top
of the cabin ladder.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<h3>THE STRANGE FLAG.</h3>


<p>After ten minutes of the most painful suspense
that any of the boys had ever known, the
three sailors returned with the report that while
one of the forward plates was bent and was leaking
slightly, there appeared to be no danger.</p>

<p>Mr. Barr made no secret of his relief at receiving
this bit of information. The boys burst
into a cheer, and Barton, crouching in cowardly
panic in the engine room, knew by this sound
that all was well.</p>

<p>"Now we'll get to the surface quick and see
what happened," declared the inventor.</p>

<p>The <i>Peacemaker</i>, which all this time had been
slowly backing, was sent upward once more. As<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
soon as they reached the surface Mr. Barr
opened the conning tower hatch, and they all
hastened out on deck. To their amazement the
water all about was dyed crimson, and the cause
was almost immediately apparent. Not far off
lay the carcass of a whale, almost cut in two.
This was beyond question the obstacle that the
submarine had struck. Probably the dead cetacean
could not get out of the way of the steel
diving craft in time, or else deemed it another
whale, and so was rammed by the sharp steel
prow.</p>

<p>"Suppose that had been a solid object, like a
rock, or a submerged derelict?" asked Rob.</p>

<p>"We shouldn't be here now," rejoined Ensign
Hargreaves calmly enough, but in his voice there
was palpable evidence of the relief he felt at their
narrow escape.</p>

<p>"I guess we'll stay on the surface for a while
now," decided the inventor. Accordingly, the
craft was put about and headed for the island at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
a good rate of speed. The return voyage was
made without incident, except that Tubby caused
much amusement by inquiring if whale flesh was
edible, and if it was, he should enjoy a broiled
whale steak for dinner.</p>

<p>When the shed was reached the bow of the
submarine was elevated by means of powerful
geared tackle provided for this purpose, and the
job of substituting a new plate for the damaged
one was begun. It was finished by sunset.</p>

<p>That afternoon Rob and Merritt took the shotguns
and started for the other shore of the island
to see if they could not bring down some
shore birds. They tramped along the beach and
met with some success. Their walk brought
them to the opposite shore of the island, as has
been said, and they found themselves in a desolate
stretch of country, nothing but sand and
brush and coarse shore grass.</p>

<p>They were discussing the odd nature of their
mission on the island, when Merritt suddenly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
grasped his companion's arm and pointed seaward,
toward another of the islands that have
been mentioned as being scattered pretty closely
in the vicinity. Rob was just in time to catch
sight of a motor boat, seemingly a fast one, slipping
behind the spot of land.</p>

<p>At the same instant a figure rose from the
grass almost in front of them. It was Barton
the machinist. He had apparently been concealed
in the grass, and had not calculated on the boys
discovering him.</p>

<p>"Well, what are you after now? Spying on
me again, eh?" he snarled angrily.</p>

<p>"I don't know why you should say we were
spying on you," rejoined Rob, "unless you are
up to something wrong."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked Barton, stepping
quickly toward him as if to strike him.</p>

<p>The man's hand was upraised, but the determined
way in which Rob met his angry glare
caused him to drop it.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 358px;">

<span class="caption">ROB WAS JUST IN TIME TO CATCH SIGHT OF A MOTOR BOAT, SLIPPING BEHIND THE SPOT OF LAND.</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>"I want you to quit followin' me around, that's
all," he said.</p>

<p>"I guess this island's big enough to hold all
of us," snapped Merritt, "and as for following
you around, we have other and better occupations
on our hands."</p>

<p>The machinist made an angry reply and set
off across the island at a rapid pace. As he did
so an odd incident took place on the island behind
which the motor boat had vanished.</p>

<p>On a staff which the boys had not previously
noticed a red flag began to glide up and down.
Sometimes it was hoisted quickly and then again
slowly.</p>

<p>"What in the world are they doing over
there?" wondered Merritt.</p>

<p>"I can't make out unless they are a party of
crazy campers amusing themselves," rejoined
Rob; and then he suddenly burst out: "By Jove,
I have it; they are signalling."</p>

<p>"But signalling what or who?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>"I haven't decided yet; but I wonder if the
same thought has occurred to you as to me?"</p>

<p>"Namely, what?"</p>

<p>"Why, that Barton was watching those signals."</p>

<p>"You mean that they were intended for him?"</p>

<p>"That's what."</p>

<p>"But what would they be signalling him for?"</p>

<p>"Only one thing that I can think of. You
know what the ensign said about spies; well, if
that fellow Barton isn't up to some crooked
work, why should he sneak off like this and be so
anxious to hide from us when we happen along
accidentally? Then, too, there's that paper covered
with drawings that I found in the engine
room."</p>

<p>"By ginger, I see what you are driving at.
You think that Barton is a traitor, and is in
league with those spies?"</p>

<p>"It's a grave accusation to make, but I can
hit on no other explanation of his actions. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
is angry at us because he thinks we may see too
much. Look, they are still signalling."</p>

<p>"I wish we could read what they are saying."</p>

<p>"I think I can," rejoined Rob quietly.</p>

<p>"You can?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"How are you going to do it?"</p>

<p>"By bringing my knowledge of Morse into
play. I think that when the flag is run up slowly
it means a dash and a quick run is a dot. Let's
try it anyway."</p>

<p>Luckily the spot where the two boys were was
grown with high, coarse grass, and the sand
dunes rose high in places, affording protection
for them.</p>

<p>As the flag rose and fell they spelled out a
word according to the Morse code.</p>

<p>"That's 'Ready'," proclaimed Rob exultingly;
"we have hit on their code, all right."</p>

<p>"They're still at it," exclaimed Merritt, as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
flag continued its eccentric rises and falls;
"what's next, I wonder?"</p>

<p>Dash&mdash;dash&mdash;dash&mdash;dash, spelled out the flag.</p>

<p>"That means 'to'," declared Rob.</p>

<p>"Yes, and there comes 'night'," exclaimed
Merritt a moment later. "And now they've
stopped. Let's see what message we've caught."</p>

<p>"Short and sweet," laughed Rob. "I guess we
came in at the tail end of their confab. All we've
got is 'Ready to-night'."</p>

<p>"Well, isn't that something?" demanded Merritt.
"At all events it's a complete sentence and
tells us that somebody will be ready for something
to-night."</p>

<p>"Right you are, and that 'somebody' is to be
Barton, I'll bet a doughnut."</p>

<p>"But ready for what?"</p>

<p>"That remains to be seen. I've always
thought Barton would bear watching. I'm certain
of it now, and if the submarine isn't mixed
up in this tangle somewhere, call me a Chinaman."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you going to tell the ensign about this?"</p>

<p>"Not till we have something more tangible to
go upon. After all, we have proved nothing,
but to-night we'll keep a close watch on Barton
and in that way find out if our suspicions are
correct or not."</p>

<p>And so it was arranged. The boys hunted a
bit more, but somehow the strange signals and
the peculiar behavior of Barton had got on
their minds, and they gave up their sport earlier
than they had expected and trudged back to camp
to complete their arrangements for the night's
work.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<h3>SCOUTING FOR UNCLE SAM.</h3>


<p>"Rob! Rob! Rob!"</p>

<p>Merritt nudged his dozing companion as they
lay near to the submarine shed, where they had
taken up their position earlier in the night. Immediately
after supper the lads had, apparently,
slipped off to their tents; but as soon as they
were sure that they were free from observation
they had, in pursuance of their plans, taken up
a position close to the sheltering place of the
<i>Peacemaker</i>.</p>

<p>Rob had dozed off shortly before midnight,
and the words at the beginning of this chapter
formed Merritt's notification to him that it was
time to bestir himself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>The boy, aroused at once from his nap, sat up
at his comrade's summons.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he asked in a whisper.</p>

<p>"Look! Look yonder! Don't you see Barton
sneaking toward the shed?"</p>

<p>There was no moon, but in the starlight
Rob, thus admonished, could distinctly discern a
shadowy figure gliding across the sand dunes to
the submarine shed.</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> Barton, sure enough!" he exclaimed in
a low, tense voice. "I guess we were right, Merritt,
when we read that 'Ready to-night' message."</p>

<p>"We sure were," was the response; "the question
now is, what is that fellow up to?"</p>

<p>"Some sort of mischief, just as we surmised,"
was the reply. "Let's do an Indian crawl toward
the shed and see what we can find out."</p>

<p>The next instant both boys were noiselessly
wriggling their way on their stomachs toward
the shed into the interior of which Barton had,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
by this time, vanished. It was easy work to make
a noiseless advance over the soft sand, but so
thoroughly had both the Boy Scouts practiced
the maneuver of silent advance that even had the
ground been different, it is likely that they could
have approached unheard.</p>

<p>Right up to the very walls of the shed they
wriggled their way and then, placing their eyes
to a crack in the timbers, they peered in. By
the yellow light of a lantern Barton had lighted
they saw him dive down into the interior of the
submarine and emerge, ere long, with several
rolled sheets of paper.</p>

<p>The fellow did not appear to labor under
anxiety that he was being watched, for he went
boldly about his business, taking no apparent
pains to screen the light or to move noiselessly.
Having emerged from the submarine and
reached once more the door of the shed, he extinguished
the light and glided out into the night
like a half-embodied form.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>Merritt half leaped to his feet as he saw the
fellow making off, but Rob drew his companion
down into their place of concealment with a
whispered,</p>

<p>"Hold on. Don't spoil everything now by betraying
our presence. Let him get a little way
and we'll follow him."</p>

<p>"But we may lose him in the darkness," objected
Merritt.</p>

<p>"I scarcely think so," was the rejoinder; "in
fact, I have a pretty good idea where he is bound
for."</p>

<p>"And where may that be?"</p>

<p>"The place in which he lay this afternoon to
read those signals from the distant island. Depend
upon it, he is going to meet the men who
manipulated that flag!"</p>

<p>"By hooky! That's so, Rob. What a mind
you have for figuring out things! Of course, it's
plain enough now that he is betraying Mr. Barr
by giving drawings and plans of the submarine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
to Mr. Barr's enemies, but I didn't think he'd
take so bold a method."</p>

<p>"There's nothing very bold about it," retorted
Rob. "He is a trusted man, and has been given
every opportunity to be dishonest, if it so suits
him."</p>

<p>"I guess that's right; but it's our duty to
thwart him."</p>

<p>"You just bet it is, and we'll do it, too, if
it's possible. See, there he goes over the top
of that sand dune. I could see his figure
silhouetted against the sky. I reckon it's safe
now to take after him."</p>

<p>"All right, you say when."</p>

<p>"I'll give the word right here. Silently, now;
remember he is on the outlook for some interference
with his plans, and a false move may
spoil everything."</p>

<p>"Don't worry about me. A first class Scout
should be able to carry through a simple little
thing like this."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't be too sure it's simple," admonished
Rob, as they silently rose from their crouching
postures and took after the vague shadow; "this
thing may turn out to be bigger than we
thought."</p>

<p>"Have you laid any plans as to what you will
do if we do apprehend him in the act of transferring
the plans to Mr. Barr's enemies?"</p>

<p>"Not yet. There's no use crossing a bridge
till you come to it."</p>

<p>Through the night the boys pursued their
quarry as silently as two snakes. At times they
lost sight of him, but always his figure would
loom up against the star-sprinkled sky as he
topped a sand dune. At length they saw him
pause and light the lantern, which he had used
in the shed, and which he still carried.</p>

<p>This done, he swung the light twice across
his body, after the fashion of a brakeman signalling
a train to come ahead.</p>

<p>Instantly, out of the darkness, flashed an answering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
beacon&mdash;a red light. The boys clasped
each other's arms. That they were on the brink
of an exciting adventure they did not doubt.
But in each lad's heart was a firm resolve that,
come what might, they would do their duty by
Uncle Sam.</p>

<p>"Was that red light shown from the other
island?" whispered Merritt.</p>

<p>"No, I am inclined to think it came from that
launch we saw sneaking in behind the island
this afternoon just before the signalling commenced,"
was the response.</p>

<p>"In that case, she must be still far out?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but in any event they would have to
send a boat ashore. That launch is too large to
land on the beach directly."</p>

<p>As if in answer to his opinion the watching
boys presently saw a red light creeping over the
water toward the island. Undoubtedly it came
from a small boat, so low on the water was it.</p>

<p>Before long they could detect the splash of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
oars, although whoever was rowing the boat
was trying to make as little noise as possible.</p>

<p>As the light drew close in shore, Merritt seized
Rob's arm.</p>

<p>"What's the next move?" he asked.</p>

<p>"It looks as if it were ours," was the quiet,
but determined, rejoinder.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<h3>ROB'S BRAVE ACT.</h3>


<p>While the boys had been watching, Barton had
lain down, as though tired, on the summit of a
near-by dune. As the red light came close in
shore, however, he arose, and once more waved
his lantern.</p>

<p>At the signal the course of the red light
shifted and headed directly toward him. The
boys' hearts beat thickly; the time for action
was at hand. The bow of the boat they had seen
approaching grated on the beach, and two figures
sprang out while Barton advanced to meet
them.</p>

<p>"Get as close as you can," whispered Rob, as
he wriggled forward; "we want to get every
word."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>Merritt merely nodded; but his silent advance
was as rapid as his leader's. Owing to the nature
of the ground, they were able to run forward
in an almost upright position when they
reached the hollows of the dunes, being compelled
to cast themselves down only when they
topped a rise. Therefore, they were within ear
shot when Barton greeted the two men who had
disembarked from the boat.</p>

<p>"Well," said one of the newcomers in a voice
which plainly betrayed his foreign origin; "well,
did you do as you said you would?"</p>

<p>"Yes," responded Barton; "I've got the drawings
here. They are not complete, however, and
you will have to give me more time."</p>

<p>"As you were told at Bridgeport, before you
left for this island, you can have all the time
you want, only make the job complete."</p>

<p>"You can depend upon me to do that," was the
response. "So long as I'm well paid, I'll sell out
all I know, and that's about everything about
the Barr submarine."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>Here another voice, that of the second man
who had left the boat, struck in:</p>

<p>"What about the models?"</p>

<p>"I've got them hidden up here in the sand,"
came Barton's voice in reply. "I'd have had
them ready but two blooming kids trailed me
here."</p>

<p>"Trailed you? What do you mean?" demanded
the voice of the man who had first
spoken and who, with the solitary exception
noted, had carried on most of the conversation.</p>

<p>"Why, this Ensign Hargreaves, this Navy
dude, saw fit to bring a band of Boy Scouts down
here. They're the nosiest kids ever, and I half
think they suspect me of not being all I appear
to be."</p>

<p>"That's a good guess," whispered Rob to Merritt.</p>

<p>Merritt could not refrain from a quiet chuckle.</p>

<p>"As a long distance and local guesser, Barton
takes the palm," he breathed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hush!" murmured Rob under his breath:
"What are they up to now?"</p>

<p>"Going to dig up those models, I guess. Barton
must have stolen them from the workshop
at odd moments."</p>

<p>Right then something happened that gave
Merritt a shock. Rob rose to his feet and started
toward the beach. The men that the two Boy
Scouts were watching had headed inland, evidently
to aid Barton in uncovering the hidden
models.</p>

<p>"Have you gone crazy, Rob? Lie down here,"
cautioned Merritt.</p>

<p>"Not much," was the response; "I'm going to
do some reconnoitering while I've got the
chance."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"That I'm going down to have a look at that
boat, and if I can I'm going to shove her off
and thus leave those men prisoners on the island."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>"By ginger, Rob, you are a great fellow for
ideas. If only you can cast the boat adrift,
we'll have those chaps bottled up as securely as
if they were in a jail."</p>

<p>"Wait here till I come," responded the boy
leader. "I won't be gone more than ten minutes."</p>

<p>"I'd like to come with you, Rob."</p>

<p>"No; this is a job I can do best alone."</p>

<p>Rob noiselessly slipped away. The boat from
which the mysterious men had landed was
plainly discernible as a black blot on the sandy
beach. Rob tried to make himself as inconspicuous
as possible, but against the white strip
of sand he felt as noticeable as an elephant.
However, he gained the boat without interruption.</p>

<p>Its bow had been built up, apparently, to make
it more seaworthy, and the boy noticed that a
small door had been cut leading into the space
beneath the raised bow. He had hardly discovered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
this when he was startled to hear voices
close at hand.</p>

<p>It was Barton and his crooked accomplices
coming back. Fortunately for Rob, they were
behind a dune, so that it was impossible for
them to observe him. But in a moment, the boy
realized with a thrill, they would be upon him.</p>

<p>Quick as a flash, and hardly realizing what he
was doing, Rob sought the only place of concealment
close at hand&mdash;the space under the raised
bow of the boat. He had hardly squeezed into
his cramped quarters before the trio of rascals
topped the rise.</p>

<p>Rob, with a sinking of the heart, realized at
that moment that it would have been better for
him to have taken his chances and run away
from the scene. But it was too late now. With
something that was not exactly fear, but very
like it, Rob recognized the fact that he was a
concealed passenger, a stowaway, on board a
boat on which his presence might cost him his
life.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>As these reflections ran through his mind the
men drew closer, talking about the "clever" work
they had done.</p>

<p>"I guess Barr and his <i>Peacemaker</i> can say
good-bye to Uncle Sam now," laughed one of
them.</p>

<p>"Yes, and the best of it is that Barton will
never be suspected," responded the other. "Our
government will be manufacturing submarines
of the Barr type, while Barr and the United
States Government are still in blissful ignorance
of the fact that all efforts are for nothing."</p>

<p>"You can bet I never put through a job unless
I do it right," struck in Barton with great self-complacency.</p>

<p>Rob, crouched in his cramped place of concealment,
flushed with anger. Right then and
there he determined that, come what might, he
would see this strange adventure of his through
to the bitter end. This resolve was still in his
mind when the two men shoved the boat off,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
bade good-night to the rascally Barton, and, all
unconscious of their secreted passenger, got
under way.</p>

<p>"If I get out of this alive, I'll be lucky," soliloquized
Rob as he heard the oars and felt the
boat moving through the water. "I wonder if
I've done right? At any rate I'm in it now, and,
as a Boy Scout, I'm going to see it through."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<h3>THE ISLAND HUT.</h3>


<p>Rob, in his place of concealment, could hear
the two men talking as they rowed.</p>

<p>Their conversation related, in the main, to
the affairs of the night. Apparently, so far as
Rob could gather, the stealing of the plans of the
submarine was not yet complete. It appeared
that Barton was to remain on the island in his
capacity as trusted aide to Mr. Barr, and to
gather up all he could of the details of the new
submarine, down to the smallest particular.</p>

<p>Scarcely daring to breathe, Rob listened with
all his might to the conversation of the oarsmen.</p>

<p>At the same time the thought was running
through his mind that he had acted rashly in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
taking the step he had. But the boy pluckily
made up his mind to stick to his resolution of
discovering just what was going on inimical
to the plans of the United States Government
and Mr. Barr.</p>

<p>Before very long the prow of the boat grated
on a sandy beach, and the two men, gathering
up some rolls of paper and several bulky-looking
objects, left the craft, first securing it by an
anchor and line.</p>

<p>As their footsteps died away, Rob ventured
to raise his head above the gunwale of the
boat and follow them with his eyes. He saw
them ascend the beach and enter the hut, apparently
a structure once used by fishermen or
hunters.</p>

<p>After an interval a light shone from the solitary
window of the hut, and Rob came to a sudden
resolve to find out just what was going forward.
With this object in view he clambered
out of the boat, taking every precaution against<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
making unnecessary noise. On hands and knees
he then approached the lighted window.</p>

<p>The night was dark, and, standing at a fair
distance from the casement, he did not feel much
fear of being seen from within. It is hard for
persons in a brightly lighted chamber to perceive
what is going on outside.</p>

<p>Seated around a rough table in the hut, which
consisted of only one room, Rob saw three men.
Two of them, undoubtedly, were those who had
unconsciously rowed him to the island. The
other he recognized with a start as the possessor
of the face which had peered through the transom
on the memorable night in Hampton, when
plans for the experiments on the island were in
process of being formulated. In other words,
the third member of the party was none other
than Nordstrom Berghoff, the spy.</p>

<p>Instantly many things that had been vague to
Rob crystallized into a clear understanding of
the situation. The signals from the island, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
indignation of Barton over the presence of the
Boy Scouts, and the stealing of the plans and
models, all stood out plainly now as being part
of an elaborate plot of which Berghoff was the
mainspring.</p>

<p>A wave of indignation swept over the boy as
he contemplated the rascals within the hut gloating
over the things they had obtained from the
treacherous Barton.</p>

<p>"The scoundrels," he thought; "so they think
they can rob Uncle Sam of one of the greatest
submarines ever invented, and do so with impunity!
I don't care what happens, I'll fool them
if I can."</p>

<p>With this resolve firmly embedded in his mind,
Rob crept closer to the window. By skillful
maneuvering he was at last almost under the
casement. In this position every word uttered
within the hut was clear to him.</p>

<p>He heard Berghoff chuckling gleefully over
the manner in which the night's work had been
carried out.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>"Undt not a vun of dose Boy Scouts knew
anting aboudt idt," he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"No," rejoined one of his companions, a
swarthy man with a pallid face on which there
stood out a bristly beard; "those kids were out
of the game so far as we were concerned. That
Barton is a slick one, all right."</p>

<p>"Well, he's getting well paid for the job,"
struck in the third man, who was short and
stocky, with a crop of rough, reddish hair and
a protruding chin that gave him a "bull doggy"
aspect.</p>

<p>"Of course, he gedts vell paid," rejoined Berghoff;
"dis job is vorth de naval supremacy of
the worldt to der country vot I represent."</p>

<p>"As if we didn't know that as well as you,"
rejoined the red-haired man. "It was lucky we
worked in the same machine shop in Bridgeport
with Barton and knew he was a man who could
be bought."</p>

<p>"Yes, there isn't much that he wouldn't do
for money," chimed in the pallid-faced man.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>"Vell, ledt us see if dese plans are all righdt,
or if ve must get some more of dem," remarked
Berghoff.</p>

<p>From his manner of examining the intricate
prints and plans, Rob knew that the man, as
were most probably his two companions, was an
engineer of no mean ability. With a small
pocket scale he went over every scrap of paper
and then fell to examining the models. From
his expression, Rob judged that Barton had
served the rascal well. Berghoff declared the
plans and the models all that would be required
to produce a <i>Peacemaker</i> almost the exact duplicate
of Mr. Barr's diving-boat.</p>

<p>"Well, when do we make our getaway?"
queried the red-haired man when the examination
was concluded.</p>

<p>"To-morrow ve go," declared Berghoff. "In
New York I catch der steamer for Europe undt
you two scatter verefer you like."</p>

<p>Rob felt his face flush with indignation, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
at the same time he experienced a sort of hopeless
feeling of indecision. The plans and the
models lay there, almost within his reach, but
so far as the possibility of recovering them was
concerned, they might as well have been in
China.</p>

<p>"If only all the boys were here," he thought,
"it would be possible to 'rush' those scoundrels
and secure all their loot."</p>

<p>Finally Rob came to the decision to remain
where he was for the present and see if some
opportunity would not present itself to recover
the articles of such vital importance to Uncle
Sam's Government.</p>

<p>The men talked on, conversing in low tones,
and presently the red-headed man started to
prepare some food on an oil stove, which must
have been brought from the motor boat earlier
in the day. Till sundry appetizing odors began
to drift out to him from the plotter's cookery,
Rob did not realize that he was hungry. Before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
long, however, his desire for food became
almost overwhelming. It was tantalizing to lie
out there in the dark, tired and hungry, and hear
within the hut the clatter of knives and forks
and inhale the odors of what was evidently a
hearty meal.</p>

<p>At length the men stopped eating, and Rob
heard them discussing whether they should sleep
in the hut or on board their motor boat. The
boy pricked up his ears as he listened. If only
they decided to sleep on the boat and leave the
models and plans in the hut, he would have a
chance to recover the stolen property and make
away with it in the beached rowboat before
dawn.</p>

<p>Rob could hardly restrain an exclamation of
delight when the men came to the decision to
pass the night on their boat.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with this stuff?"
inquired the pallid-faced man with the stubbly
beard, indicating the mass of papers and models.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, we'll leave that here till morning," was
Berghoff's response; "dere is no use in taking
idt by der boat now."</p>

<p>"Goodness," thought Rob, "I sure am in luck!
It will be no trick at all to get that stuff as soon
as they have gone, and carry it back to the island.
I almost wish it was going to be a harder task.
It's a bit too much like burglary to suit me."</p>

<p>But Rob was not to have such an easy time of
it as he anticipated.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<h3>A CHASE IN THE NIGHT.</h3>


<p>The men left the hut, banging the door behind
them. Rob waited till the sound of their
voices grew dim in the distance, and then raising
himself cautiously he crept around to the
door of the hut.</p>

<p>The light had been extinguished, but as the
boy had matches in his waterproof case this fact
did not worry him. Pushing the door open Rob
entered the place. Before striking a light he did
all he could to assure himself that he was not
likely to be interrupted by the sudden return of
the men.</p>

<p>Having established to his satisfaction that he
was safe, which was not until he perceived a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
light on the motor boat, which lay not far from
the hut, he proceeded to light up the lantern the
men had left behind.</p>

<p>Anxious not to lose any time on his risky task,
he began stuffing papers and plans into his
pockets at once. The models, or most of them,
he decided he would have to convey to the boat
in his arms.</p>

<p>He had hardly completed the task of stowing
the papers in his pockets, when he was startled
at hearing footsteps coming toward the hut.
Hastily he extinguished the light, uttering an
inward prayer that it had not been seen. Luckily
for himself he had taken the precaution of closing
the door as soon as he had the lantern
lighted.</p>

<p>Just before extinguishing the lamp, he had
gazed about the place for some spot of concealment.
But the hut, as has been said, was a crude
affair, and no closets or cupboards presented a
chance of hiding. The only thing that Rob<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
could think of to do was to slip under the table
and trust to a miracle that he would not be discovered.
Hardly had he carried out his intention
when the door opened and two men entered.</p>

<p>They were the red-headed man and the pallid-faced
individual, who appeared to act as assistants
to Berghoff. At any rate, judging by their
accents, they were foreigners.</p>

<p>Rob had placed the lantern on the table in a
position as much resembling that in which the
men had left it as he could. He heard a match
scratched and then the sputter of the flame.</p>

<p>"Don't see why Berghoff sent us back to get
that stuff," grumbled one of the men angrily;
"it's as safe here as it would be anywhere."</p>

<p>"Well, as we're getting good pay fer this job,
we might as well obey orders," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Gee whillakers!" came a sudden exclamation
from the man who had attempted to light the
lantern.</p>

<p>"What's up?" asked the other.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, the plagued thing is red hot!"</p>

<p>"Red hot?" exclaimed his companion in tones
of amazement. "How can that be when it's a
good half hour since we put it out?"</p>

<p>"Dunno, but it burned my fingers, all right."</p>

<p>"Say, Mike, do you think anyone has been here
since we left?"</p>

<p>"Who could have been here? And yet, come
to think of it, it's blamed queer. Tell you what
we'll do."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Search this place. It won't take long."</p>

<p>"Good for you," rejoined the other, while Rob
quaked in his place of concealment.</p>

<p>"There ain't many nooks or crannies, so the
job won't take long."</p>

<p>"That's right. We'll begin by looking under
the table&mdash;&mdash;Jeehosophat!"</p>

<p>The sudden exclamation was caused by Rob's
suddenly springing up, upsetting the table and
planting his fist full in the fellow's face. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
lantern was dropped in the excitement and the
hut was plunged in darkness. Rob had come to
his sudden decision to act as he did as the only
way to escape the men.</p>

<p>For a time it looked as if he would be successful.
Dashing past the man who remained on
his feet he made for the direction in which he
knew the door lay. In fact, as the men had not
closed it, he had no difficulty in locating it by
the starlight outside.</p>

<p>"Hey! Stop! Stop!" roared the fellow behind
him.</p>

<p>Rob sped on like the wind, using every ounce
of running ability he possessed. Straight for the
beach he made, devoting all his energies to a
swiftly formed plan to get into the beached boat
and row to safety. It was a desperate plan, but
he had no other resources.</p>

<p>He was within a few yards of the beach when
a dark form loomed suddenly before him. In
the starlight Rob saw something glittering in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
the newcomer's hand. This object was leveled at
him, and a stern voice commanded him to stop
or be shot.</p>

<p>Rob, with a throbbing heart, pulled up. He
recognized the voice as that of Berghoff and
knew that if he did not obey the order the desperate
ruffian would have no hesitation in sending
a bullet into him.</p>

<p>Berghoff, who had been aroused by the cries
of his aides when Rob escaped from the hut,
came up to the lad, keeping him covered with his
wicked-looking "gun."</p>

<p>"Who are you? What you doing here?" he
demanded sternly.</p>

<p>The next moment, and before Rob could reply,
the fellow noted the Boy Scout uniform.</p>

<p>"Oh, ho!" he exclaimed in a malignant tone.
"So you are one of dose Boy Scouts, eh? You
think you pretty smart, eh? You vait. I may
make you pay for your fun."</p>

<p>There was a cold sort of malice in the man's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
way of speaking that actually sent a chill down
Rob's spine.</p>

<p>But he plucked up courage to make a bold
reply.</p>

<p>"I know the sort of illegal trafficking you are
engaged in, Berghoff," he said boldly, "and I
tell you, you had better leave me alone."</p>

<p>"Is dot so?" sneered the fellow. "You haven't
seen the last of me for a long time yet."</p>

<p>"My friends will punish you for this," exclaimed
Rob, in as confident a tone as he could
assume.</p>

<p>"It vill be a long time alretty before you see
your friendts again," jeered the other. "Ah,
here comes Mike and Gyp, now. Now ve findt
out what you vos doing up by der hut."</p>

<p>As the spy had said, the two men who had been
in the hut came up at the moment.</p>

<p>Berghoff instantly demanded to know what
had occurred in the hut.</p>

<p>"By gosh, cap," said the red-headed man who,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
it seemed, was "Mike," "it happened so sudden
I can hardly tell you. We goes up there to get
them papers as you told us, and the first thing
you know out jumps this young catamount and
hits me a swat on the jaw that 'most put me
out fer the count."</p>

<p>"That's right," corroborated his companion;
"that's just what he done, cap."</p>

<p>"How did he get here?" demanded Berghoff
angrily.</p>

<p>"Dunno, unless he flew," rejoined Mike helplessly.
"Hadn't we better search the young varmint
and see what he's got in his pockets?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you had better search him at once."</p>

<p>"My last chance has gone," thought Rob as
the two fellows seized him roughly and began
rummaging his pockets.</p>

<p>It would have been worse than useless to resist,
so Rob submitted to the search, while Berghoff
stood looking grimly on as the papers were
extracted from his pockets by the two ruffians.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>"If only I'd hurried a little more," thought
Rob to himself bitterly. "If only I'd hurried,
I'd not have been in this predicament now."</p>

<p>"So you almost got avay mit vot you came
after," exclaimed Berghoff as the last of the
papers was removed from Rob's pockets and
handed over to the spy; "it voss an inspiration
dot made me send my men back by der huts."</p>

<p>"What will we do with the kid?" asked the
man known as Mike.</p>

<p>"I don't know yet," was the rejoinder in a
harsh voice. "Ve ought to throw him in der
sea. He knows too much aboudt us."</p>

<p>"That's right, cap," came from Gyp, the pallid-faced
man, "it's just as Barton told us, these
blamed Boy Scouts are on to us."</p>

<p>"Vell, it don't be goodt to get ridt of him
righdt now. Better bring him aboard the boat."</p>

<p>"All right, cap. Come on, you young sneak!"
said the man known as Mike.</p>

<p>He gave Rob's arm a vicious twist, and with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
one of the men on either side of him, and Berghoff
walking close behind with the revolver,
there was no recourse for Rob but to accept the
situation as it came. But in mind he was casting
about desperately for a means of escape.
None had occurred to him by the time they
reached the motor boat, which was moored at
a tumble-down wharf, or jetty.</p>

<p>The motor boat proved to be a sixty-foot affair,
with a cabin amidships. Into this Rob was
gruffly ordered.</p>

<p>"Get aboard now, and look slippy about it,"
was Mike's way of urging the Boy Scout on
board the craft.</p>

<p>Rob obeyed the order with a sinking heart
Things looked about as black as they could be,
so even his optimistic nature was compelled to
admit.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<h3>ON BOARD A STRANGE CRAFT.</h3>


<p>Once inside the main cabin Rob was thrust
into a small stateroom opening off the larger
apartment. He heard the lock click as the door
was slammed to, and knew that he was a
prisoner.</p>

<p>It was dark inside the cabin, but by feeling
about he discovered a bunk on one side of the
place. Critical as his situation was, the boy was
so tired that he flung himself down on this, and,
before long, while still pondering his quandary,
he sank into a deep slumber.</p>

<p>When he awakened it was broad daylight. By
the motion of the craft Rob knew that she was at
sea. Getting up from the bunk he peered out of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
the small porthole of the stateroom. Outside
nothing but the ocean was to be seen. Of course
the boy had not the slightest idea where they
were, or how long the boat had been running.</p>

<p>All he did know was that he was a prisoner,
ravenously hungry, achingly thirsty and almost
fagged out. His slumbers had been uneasy and
had not refreshed him.</p>

<p>Outside he could hear voices in the larger
cabin. Crawling to the keyhole he listened intently.
Berghoff was talking. Rob heard
enough to convince him that the plans of the
band had been changed.</p>

<p>"There vill be a big hue undt cry ven dey
findt oudt der boy is gone," declared Berghoff.
"We must findt some place where we can stop till
der excitement dies out."</p>

<p>"That's right, cap," agreed one of his companions,
"but where can we go?"</p>

<p>"There are plenty of small islands further
down the coast. One of those would suit our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
purpose," struck in another voice, which Rob
recognized as that of the pallid-faced Gyp.</p>

<p>"Dot's a good idea," agreed Berghoff; "gedt
out der chart and look one up."</p>

<p>The voice sank into inaudibility and Rob threw
himself back on the bunk. At least he knew
now what to expect, isolation and captivity with
three desperate men. It would be wrong to say
the lad was frightened. Possibly the very nature
of his predicament had dulled his brain, as
is sometimes the case.</p>

<p>"I wonder if they are looking for me now?"
he mused, and with the thought came a glad
realization that Merritt knew of the signals from
the island and would inform the ensign of them.</p>

<p>"If they only follow me up quickly, maybe
they can overtake this craft," he said to himself,
"although she's a fast one."</p>

<p>At this juncture of Rob's cogitations the door
was thrust open and Gyp entered with some food
and water.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>He placed them on the floor and started to
leave the room in sullen silence, when Rob
stopped him.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with me?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Don't ask no questions and you'll get told no
lies," growled the man, slamming the door and
relocking it on the outside.</p>

<p>"Well," thought Rob, "it's plain that I'm to be
kept in the dark as to my fate. Well, it's no use
worrying. I'll tackle this food and take a good
long drink of water and then see if I can come to
any conclusion."</p>

<p>The meal brightened Rob up wonderfully.
After eating it he sat on the edge of the bunk
casting about for something to keep his mind off
his troubles, when he suddenly recollected the
mysterious cipher found on the <i>Good Hope</i>.</p>

<p>Reaching into his pocket he pulled it out and
began figuring with the stump of a pencil on
the back of an old envelope. But ingenious as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
he was, he found it hard to decipher. He tried
half a dozen well-known systems on it and was
about to give up in despair when he recalled the
"Letter" method of reading cryptic numeral
ciphers.</p>

<p>This system requires the operator to figure out
the recurrence of different numerals and the
order in which they appear. Rob noticed that
the number 5 occurred most frequently. Now
E is the most used letter in any bit of English
writing, so the lad set down 5 as answering
for E.</p>

<p>After this he figured industriously till he had
managed to make something like sense out of the
first paragraph of the old writing.</p>

<p>It would be wearisome to take the matter step
by step in all its details. Suffice it to say, therefore,
that Rob found that he had hit on a correct
system and at the end of two hours had the
following message before him.</p>

<p>"It is buried twenty-four paces from dead<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
cypress and to the west. The island lies in long.
80 degrees 50 minutes and lat. 33 degrees 24
minutes. To whoever finds this and reads it, I
will the ivory. Death is close to me now. Good
bye to all."</p>

<p>When his task had been completed, Rob sat
gazing at the paper before him. Unquestionably
it gave the location of the dead whaler's cache.
For an instant the boy thought, with a thrill, that
he was within reach of a fortune. But the next
moment he recalled where he was, which, in the
interest of his task, he had forgotten. Then, too,
he remembered that the dead man's two companions
who marooned him on his own ship had
probably carried out their intention of returning
and carrying off the precious hoard.</p>

<p>"So that's all of that," mused the boy, "but
just the same, if I ever get out of this scrape, I
mean to hunt up that island and see if I can
locate the fate of those mammoth tusks."</p>

<p>All day the boat moved swiftly along, and it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
was not till the following morning that anchor
was dropped, as Rob knew by feeling the motion
of the craft stopped, and by hearing the rattle
of the anchor chain.</p>

<p>"I wonder what is going to happen to me
now?" he mused.</p>

<p>He had not long to wait.</p>

<p>"Come out on deck and help us row the dinghy
ashore," Gyp muttered as he unlocked the door.</p>

<p>Heartily glad to get out of his cramped quarters,
Rob obeyed.</p>

<p>Coming on deck he found Berghoff and Mike
already there. The former had a formidable-looking
revolver strapped on him. The boat was
lying off a small, sandy island, isolated from the
others, in one of the groups that are common on
that part of the coast.</p>

<p>It was wooded and appeared to be a fine spot
for Berghoff's purpose of remaining in seclusion
till Rob's friends gave him up for lost, and the
mystery of his capture blew over.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>The dinghy, which hung on the davits astern,
was lowered, and Rob roughly told to "pile in
and row us ashore." He obeyed the order, noticing
that in the boat were tent and camping supplies.
Evidently these had been placed in it before
he was called on deck.</p>

<p>His heart sank as he observed these preparations
for an extended stay on the lonely island.
Once ashore, he was forced to help in putting
up the tent, building a fire and doing other jobs
to make the camp habitable. Then, without food,
he was set to chopping wood. After a hasty
meal, Berghoff disappeared, leaving Rob
guarded by Gyp and Mike, who lay at full
length smoking lazily while he worked.</p>

<p>When Berghoff returned he announced that
there was no trace of humanity on the island.
With this statement vanished Rob's last hope of
help. He had nourished a secret aspiration that
there might be some campers or fishermen living
on the place.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>When the sun set that night Rob's feelings
were down to zero. The very fact that he was
not closely watched seemed to prove to him the
utter impossibility of his escaping. True, there
was the boat, but that had been drawn up on the
beach by his wily captors so that it would be impossible
for him to move it without attracting
their attention.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

<h3>OFF ON A SEA TRAIL.</h3>


<p>As minutes and then hours elapsed and Rob
did not return, Merritt became first anxious, and
then seriously alarmed. He knew Rob's daring
nature, and had a keen fear that it might have
led him into doing something reckless.</p>

<p>It was almost dawn when he at length determined
to return to the encampment and seek
out Ensign Hargreaves. By the time he had
tramped back over the sandy dunes day was
breaking, and in the camp of the Boy Scouts
the notes of the morning bugle were ringing out
cheerily. The first of the Scouts to note Merritt's
return was Donald Grant.</p>

<p>He came running toward him, and then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
stopped short as he noted the other's drawn, tired
face.</p>

<p>"Why, what in the world's the matter with
you, Merry?" he gasped out. "You look as if
you'd been drawn through a knothole. Where's
Rob? Where have you been all night?"</p>

<p>"I'll explain that later," said Merritt wearily;
"just now I've got to find Ensign Hargreaves.
Rob's either been kidnapped or lost."</p>

<p>He hastened on, leaving the other lad rooted
to the spot with amazement and alarm. He knew
Merritt well enough already to realize that the
other was not the sort of lad to overrate a situation.
If Merritt was as scared and weary as he
looked, something serious indeed must have
taken place.</p>

<p>In the meantime Merritt hastened to Ensign
Hargreaves' tent. Hastily arousing him, he
hurriedly explained the whole matter. The officer
was out of his cot in an instant.</p>

<p>"You had no business to go off alone like that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
without notifying me," he exclaimed rather
sharply. "Don't you know that the first duty of
a soldier, a sailor or a scout is to obey orders?"</p>

<p>Merritt crimsoned and hung his head. He
knew that the officer was right.</p>

<p>"We thought we were doing a good thing,"
he said, "but I know now that we did wrong in
not notifying you."</p>

<p>The ensign's hand fell on the lad's shoulder.
Then kindly enough he said:</p>

<p>"Well, acknowledging that you did wrong is
a manly thing, my boy, and we'll say no more
about the matter. But about Rob, something
must be done right away. Arouse Mr. Barr
while I am dressing and we'll set about searching
for him at once. There's little doubt in my
mind but that he is on that island where you saw
the signals flying."</p>

<p>"But how could he get there unless he had an
airship?" inquired Merritt.</p>

<p>"Hasn't it occurred to you that he might have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
hidden in the boat while the men were out of it?"</p>

<p>"Gracious! In that case he may be their
prisoner by this time!"</p>

<p>"I am afraid that there is little doubt of that.
We must get after the rascals at once."</p>

<p>By the time the ensign was dressed, Mr. Barr
was also attired, and the two immediately began
a discussion of plans for the rescue of Rob. But
first the ensign wanted to know about Barton.</p>

<p>It was hard for Mr. Barr to believe that the
man whom he trusted implicitly could have
proved traitor to him.</p>

<p>"The best way to find that out is to look at
your papers and models and see if anything is
missing," was the response.</p>

<p>"I'll do so; but I'm sure the boys must be mistaken
in Barton. He has worked for me for
many years."</p>

<p>"Possibly the large price he was offered to
turn over the plans of the <i>Peacemaker</i> had something
to do with it," suggested Merritt.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps; but I'll not say anything till I find
out definitely that something is missing."</p>

<p>Mr. Barr hastened off toward the shed, but returned
before long with a countenance filled with
apprehension.</p>

<p>"My most important blue prints and models
are missing!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>The ensign made a dry grimace.</p>

<p>"Our young friends were right," he said. "In
detecting the rascal they have done an excellent
piece of scouting work. But now let us hurry
off in search of Rob at once."</p>

<p>"How will you reach that other island?" asked
Merritt.</p>

<p>"We will go in the motor boat. She is fast
and does not draw much water."</p>

<p>"Can we all go along?"</p>

<p>"No, we'll take one of my sailors, your chum
Donald, Tubby Hopkins, you and myself. We
haven't settled accounts with Barton yet, and I
don't want him left practically alone on the
island."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you think he would try to harm the submarine?"</p>

<p>"I think it likely. He has probably been paid
to injure it so that the rival power that is working
against us can construct its submarines
first."</p>

<p>"But you are going to make him confess?"</p>

<p>"If he will, yes. If not, he faces a long prison
term, although it will be hard to prove that he
actually stole the papers and models."</p>

<p>"But we saw him answering those signals, and
then again, last night we saw him meet the men."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid that wouldn't make very good evidence
in a court of law," was the rejoinder.
"But enough of this now. Tell Hawkins (one of
the sailors) to get the boat ready, and hurry
through your breakfast We'll start right afterward."</p>

<p>"We can't start too quick for me," was the
brisk reply. "Poor old Rob, I wonder what has
happened to him."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>While he ate a hasty meal Merritt outlined to
the other Scouts what had happened. Following
this, Ensign Hargreaves announced a change
of his plans. He had decided, he said, to take
Barton along, not caring to leave the man on
the island.</p>

<p>"He is clever and dangerous," he said, "and
I want him under my eye till I have decided how
to dispose of his case."</p>

<p>"You are not going to let him know you suspect
him?" asked Merritt.</p>

<p>"For the present, no. As to what I shall do
in the future, I have not yet made up my mind."</p>

<p>Ten minutes later a black motor boat shot out
of the little inlet in which she had been moored.
As she sped seaward, making for the other island,
those left behind set up the cry of the Eagle
and Wolf patrols.</p>

<p>Barton, looking sullen and suspicious, was at
the engines. He knew the object of the trip, but,
of course, had no knowledge that his part in it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
was suspected. Nor did any of the party show
him by looks or words that so much as a breath
of suspicion attached to him. This was by the
orders of Ensign Hargreaves, who had determined
to give the fellow plenty of rope.</p>

<p>As the <i>Viper</i>, as the black motor boat was
called, raced over the water, Merritt found himself
gloomily contemplating the future. If anything
serious had happened to Rob, he felt that
he would be in a measure responsible for allowing
the young leader of the Eagles to go off
alone.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>

<h3>A MIDNIGHT ADVENTURE.</h3>


<p>Half an hour after her start, the <i>Viper</i> glided
alongside the island from which Merritt had
seen the signals go up the afternoon before. He
could not forbear to take a glance at Barton as
the ensign ordered the engines stopped.</p>

<p>The machinist was stooping over the motor to
hide his agitation; but by the trembling of his
hands Merritt could tell that the fellow was apprehensive
of something that might involve himself.
As soon as the anchor dropped, the motor
boat's dinghy was drawn up alongside and the
ensign and Merritt boarded it. The others were
left on board the <i>Viper</i> with whispered orders
from the officer to watch Barton's every move.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
The island was a small one, and from its highest
point it was possible to see all around it. To
Merritt's bitter disappointment, however, no sign
of another motor boat was in sight. Their
quarry had flown.</p>

<p>"There's but one thing to do," declared the
ensign; "we must make for that small hut over
yonder and search it thoroughly. It may yield
a clue of some kind."</p>

<p>A short walk brought them to the hut which
had been the scene of the stirring events of
the preceding night. Hardly had they entered
the door before Merritt gave a start of surprise
and a swift exclamation.</p>

<p>"Look! Look there!" he cried. "There's
Rob's hat!"</p>

<p>Sure enough, lying in a corner was the boy
leader's campaign hat, which he had lost in the
scuffle with Mike and Gyp.</p>

<p>"Well, that shows conclusively enough that he
was here last night, and from that upset table<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
and the general look of things, I should imagine
there had been a pretty lively scrap here," commented
the ensign.</p>

<p>"But where can Rob be now?"</p>

<p>"Probably fearing discovery if they remained
here, the men who have taken the plans and
the models carried him off, too."</p>

<p>"How will it ever be possible to obtain a clew
as to where they have gone?"</p>

<p>The ensign's answer appeared enigmatical.</p>

<p>"Could you describe the motor boat you saw
off here yesterday?"</p>

<p>"Well, she was of a very remarkable color&mdash;a
light green, with a signal mast sticking up
amidships. Then, too, her cabin was unusually
high."</p>

<p>"Good. Such a boat as that ought not to be
very hard to locate."</p>

<p>"I don't quite understand."</p>

<p>"Well, then I'll explain. These waters are
fairly well traveled, and by working our wireless<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
we may be able to get into communication
with some boat similarly equipped, which may
have seen that green motor boat."</p>

<p>"Cracky, that's a good idea," cried the admiring
boy; "let's go back and try it at once."</p>

<p>"Yes, it's small use our waiting about here.
The rascals overreached us by getting away as
quick as possible. I suppose they didn't want to
run any chances of discovery."</p>

<p>The return to the <i>Viper</i> was quickly made,
and the motor boat was driven back to the Submarine
Island at top speed. Barton tried with
all his might to overhear what was said in the
bow of the boat where the Boy Scouts had gathered;
but the ensign was careful to keep his voice
low, and then, too, the noise of the engines precluded
the machinist from catching a word, hard
as he strained his ears.</p>

<p>Under the tutoring of Hiram Nelson, the wireless
scout, the others had all become fair operators.
It was agreed that day and night one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
of them should be at the apparatus, seeking for
news of the green motor boat.</p>

<p>It was the ensign's opinion that the craft would
not put into a port immediately, fearing a hue
and cry, but would cruise about or hide in some
little frequented part of the coast. But he hoped
that if the wireless "caught" some vessel that
had spoken to her, he could at least obtain a line
on which direction she had taken.</p>

<p>The first "session" at the wireless was taken
by Hiram, then came the others in rotation; but
when at ten o'clock that night Donald, who had
learned wireless on his father's yacht, came on
duty, there had come no word from the air of
a green motor boat. Several ships had been
spoken to, but not one reported anything to give
the boys hope.</p>

<p>"Well, good-night, old man," said Merritt, as
Donald, who relieved him, came on duty, "and
good luck."</p>

<p>"I'll keep a good watch out, all right," was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
the earnest response. "It's our only way to get
poor old Rob back."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid so," sighed Merritt, leaving the
place with a despondent air. As Donald had said,
it was a chance&mdash;but what a long, seemingly
hopeless one!</p>

<p>Donald, left alone, began sending out calls,
and every little while he paused for an answer
out of space to his appeals. As he pressed the
sending key the blue, lithe spark leaped and
crackled between its points like a fiery snake.
Then all would become silent again as he listened
for an answer to his call.</p>

<p>Once he caught a steamer bound north and
carried on quite a conversation with its operator.
He felt quite lonesome when he closed down his
sending apparatus with a parting "good-bye."</p>

<p>It was very still about the encampment. So
still, in fact, that the boy began to feel more and
more lonesome. He longed for someone to talk
to; but he knew that chance would not come till
Tubby, his relief, appeared.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>The stout youth was almost due when Donald
suddenly got into communication with a steamer
called the <i>Cambria</i>, bound north from New Orleans
to New York. He put his customary query
about the green motor boat.</p>

<p>"A green motor boat?" came back the reply.</p>

<p>"Yes," flashed Donald.</p>

<p>"With one signal mast and a high cabin?"</p>

<p>"Yes! yes," shot out Donald, pounding the key
excitedly. "Have you seen such a craft?"</p>

<p>"We sighted her this evening."</p>

<p>The boy's fingers shook as he wrote down the
reply with flying pencil on the scratch pad at his
elbow.</p>

<p>"Down off some islands about Lat. 80 deg.,
Long. 33 deg.," came the answer. "She was
coming straight toward us and then all of a sudden
she headed away. Seemed like she didn't
want to get near us. Is that all?"</p>

<p>"Yes; good-bye, and thank you," flashed back
Donald exultantly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>His fingers had hardly left the key before he
was startled by a soft footfall behind him.</p>

<p>The boy wheeled like a flash and then almost
fell off his chair. Facing him, with an ugly-looking
revolver in his hand, was Barton, the
machinist.</p>

<p>There was a mean sneer on his sinister face
as he snarled out:</p>

<p>"Let me see that message and let me see it
quick."</p>

<p>"I've got no message for you," responded Donald,
determined not to let the man know that he
had information of the green motor boat's
whereabouts.</p>

<p>"That's a lie," snarled Barton; "don't monkey
with me. I've got this gun and, jingo, I know
how to use it, too."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>

<h3>THE DEPTHS OF OLD OCEAN.</h3>


<p>Just as Donald, who was no match physically
for the burly machinist, was pondering what to
do, the door which was open became filled by a
rotund figure.</p>

<p>It was Tubby.</p>

<p>In a jiffy he took in the scene, the threatening
attitude of Barton, the alarmed look of Donald,
who stood staring at the revolver like a bird
fascinated by a snake. Tubby realized that it
was no time for thinking the situation over. Instead,
he crouched low, and then, darting forward
with surprising agility, he seized the
machinist around the legs before the fellow knew
what was happening.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>Taken utterly by surprise, and borne off his
feet by Tubby's rush, Barton came crashing to
the floor in a heap. As he fell the revolver exploded,
the bullet passing by Donald's head.</p>

<p>Barton struggled desperately with Tubby, but
the stout youth held on to him like a leech, at
the same time yelling for help. In a few seconds
the ensign and Mr. Barr came rushing in, followed
by the Boy Scouts and the sailors. There
was an end to the battle then and there. After
a brief resistance Barton, snarling and cursing,
was tied hand and foot, and the ensign ordered
him locked up in the dining room shed for the
present.</p>

<p>Donald soon told his story and proudly exhibited
the message from the air which told of
sighting the green motor boat. All agreed that
it was a cheering bit of news.</p>

<p>"If they were near a lot of islands when
sighted, it is most probable that they are hiding
on one of the group. At all events, having the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
latitude and longitude, it will be easy to go down
there and see."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do about Barton? We
have full proof of his villainy now," struck in
Merritt.</p>

<p>"I suppose we shall have to take him along
with us. We can't waste time going ashore
now and risking the law's delays. We will go
down the coast in the submarine with the <i>Viper</i>
acting as escort, and Barton a prisoner on the
<i>Peacemaker</i>," decided the ensign.</p>

<p>"I wonder why he was so anxious to see
that message?" spoke Tubby.</p>

<p>"I guess he knew we were trying to trace the
green motor boat, and was watching the wireless
through that window. When he saw Donald
busy taking a message, he guessed what it
was, and decided that it was necessary for him
to see it," hazarded Mr. Barr. "How I have
been deceived in the rascal!"</p>

<p>"You certainly have. His actions show him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
to be a scoundrel of the worst type," agreed the
ensign.</p>

<p>There was not much more sleep for anybody
that night. Excitement ran far too high for
that. An attempt was made to force Barton to
confess his part in the conspiracy, but he sullenly
refused to talk.</p>

<p>"You've got nothing on me," was all he would
vouchsafe. "Anything those tin soldier kids tell
you is patched up out of whole cloth."</p>

<p>Slumber being out of the question, the rest of
the night was devoted to stocking both craft
with food and water in good quantities. In this
work the Scouts helped with a will. They were
aided by the three sailors, who were to be left
behind to guard the island, and therefore did not
work any too hard.</p>

<p>Dawn found all in readiness, and at the summons
of the bugle all lined up before Ensign
Hargreaves to receive their orders. To the submarine
were assigned Merritt and Donald, besides<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
Mr. Barr, Ensign Hargreaves, and the
prisoner Barton. The <i>Viper's</i> crew was captained
by Tubby, a capable motor boat engineer,
and Hiram and the others. When this had been
done, Barton was led before Ensign Hargreaves.</p>

<p>"Barton," said he sternly, "you have acted
the part of a scoundrel and should be behind the
bars now. But I need you for work, and upon
the manner in which you perform it, will depend
just how severe your punishment will be. Cast
him loose, men, and take him into the engine
room of the submarine. You are to stand by for
orders."</p>

<p>"I'll try to do my best, sir," rejoined Barton
in a soft tone of voice, very unusual for him.
"I'm sorry, sir, for what I did, but I was led
astray by promises of money."</p>

<p>This change in the man was almost startling.
From a sullen, morose fellow he had suddenly,
or so it seemed, become a dutiful, attentive man,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
willing to obey orders and do his best. Was
all this genuine? We shall have to go further to
see.</p>

<p>There being no excuse for delay, and as all
were anxious to get off as quickly as possible,
the two craft were boarded. The hatch of the
submarine was left open for the present, for it
was the intention of the ensign to run "awash,"
as it is called.</p>

<p>The motor boat running very nearly as fast as
the submarine, they kept each other company
down the coast with little difficulty. It was fine,
exciting sport in the motor boat as it cut its way
over the swells, hurling spray and water out to
either side of its sharp bow. If only the boys
had had Rob with them, they would have enjoyed
it much more, though.</p>

<p>All that was visible of the submarine was the
top of her conning tower, and the slender, needle-like
"eye" of the periscope. The water surged
round her conning tower as she rushed along,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
for all the world like some sea monster speeding
on an errand of destruction. She was not going
full speed, for the ensign wished to keep company
with the motor boat.</p>

<p>At noon, just as the lads on the motor boat
were settling down to lunch cooked on a blue-flame
stove, a head was thrust out of the conning
tower. It was that of Mr. Barr.</p>

<p>"We are going to run under the surface in
a short time," he said; "just follow your same
course, and you'll pick us up when we rise
again."</p>

<p>"All right," shouted Tubby, his mouth full of
ham sandwich, which he held in one hand, while
with the other he clasped a big wedge of pie.</p>

<p>The hatch on top of the conning tower closed
shortly after with a metallic "clang." The next
instant the craft vanished from view in a swirl
of water. For a time the tip of the periscope
tube, which was twenty-five feet long, projected
above the surface; then that, too, vanished, and
the motor boat was alone on the ocean.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>On board the submarine the lads were enjoying
themselves as much as their fellow Scouts
on the motor boat. This second experience was
even more novel and enjoyable than their first
dive. Mr. Barr sat in the cabin reading some
scientific works. Barton, seemingly a changed
character, was at work in the engine room. The
negro cook was in the galley, while in the conning
tower the ensign was giving Donald and
Merritt a lesson in handling a diving craft.</p>

<p>In fact, it was Merritt who was at the deflecting
apparatus when the occupants of Tubby's
boat saw the submarine sink.</p>

<p>"That is the descending lever and this the ascending
one," explained the officer before Merritt
sent the boat under the surface.</p>

<p>The levers were small affairs and looked
fragile for the work they did of starting up the
mighty pumps that caused the boat to rise or
sink at will.</p>

<p>"What if one of them should break or be
lost?" asked Donald.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, if we were under water and the ascending
lever happened to be missing, we should be
in an awkward position, and I don't believe that
Mr. Barr carries an extra one."</p>

<p>"Gracious! Then if the lever was lost we
should have to stay at the bottom of the sea?"</p>

<p>"That's about the size of it," was the reply.</p>

<p>Mr. Barr, coming into the conning tower just
then, confirmed the officer's suspicion that no
extra lever was carried.</p>

<p>"I admit there ought to be one as a matter of
precaution," he said, "but we were in such a
hurry to give the boat her tests that we forgot
about it."</p>

<p>All the afternoon the submarine ran under
the water, rising about sunset to the surface.
In the distance was the motor boat, but far in
the rear. The <i>Peacemaker</i> was sent around in
circle and soon came alongside her companion
craft.</p>

<p>Then the hatchway was opened and the ensign<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
shouted some orders to Tubby. The submarine
was going to dive once more, but would
come up before dark. When night fell a red
light would be carried astern which the motor
craft was to follow throughout the night. When
this had been made clear, the <i>Peacemaker</i> dived
once more, but this time it had been decided to
send her down to a good depth.</p>

<p>"We will eat an early supper under water just
for the novelty of it," declared Mr. Barr.</p>

<p>While the meal was going forward Barton was
sent into the conning tower to navigate the craft.
He obeyed with the same smooth complacence
with which he had received every order since
his attack on Donald. Evidently the man was
hoping, by good behavior, to save himself from
a long jail sentence.</p>

<p>After supper Barton was relieved, and Merritt
sent to the wheel in his place. He had been in
the conning tower but a short time when he was
joined by Ensign Hargreaves and Mr. Barr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>"I guess we'll go to the surface now," said the
inventor; "it must be almost dark up above."</p>

<p>Merritt reached for the lever that operated the
ascending pumps. Right then he received the
most acute and alarming shock of his life.</p>

<p>There was no lever there!</p>

<p>"It's gone!" he shouted.</p>

<p>"What? What's gone?" repeated the inventor
in a puzzled tone.</p>

<p>"The lever! The ascending lever! We can't
rise to the surface without it."</p>

<p>The inventor turned pale. Drops of sweat
stood out on his forehead. Even the ensign
turned a shade whiter than usual.</p>

<p>If the lever could not be discovered, they were
doomed to an awful death in the depths of the
sea!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>

<h3>ROB MAKES A DISCOVERY.</h3>


<p>Rob, disconsolate and miserable, passed a bad
night, and rose early. As his captors were still
asleep and had, apparently, made no effort to
guard him, he decided to make a tour of the
island himself. For one thing, he was by no
means sure that Berghoff had been speaking the
truth when he said that the place was uninhabited;
and again he thought that some form of
escape might present itself if only he investigated
the place thoroughly.</p>

<p>So the lad tiptoed out of the camp, first taking
the precaution to fill his pockets with food. He
headed straight into the woods, planning to come
out again when he had traveled a safe distance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
from the camp. He followed out this idea, pushing
his way through the brush for a time, and
then emerging on a strip of white beach that
seemed to extend around the island.</p>

<p>He trudged along, keeping a bright lookout,
but saw nothing that would further his prospects
of getting away. All at once, though, as he came
around the other side of the little spot of land,
he saw another island lying at no great distance
off. And on the beach of this island was a boat.</p>

<p>A more welcome sight could not have presented
itself to the boy's eyes just then. It meant
that there was somebody on the island,&mdash;somebody
who would surely be glad to help out a lad
in his predicament.</p>

<p>"But how on earth am I to get over there?"
mused the lad. "The tide is running like a mill
race, and I don't know whether I'm a strong
enough swimmer to buck it."</p>

<p>Then another idea occurred to him. Just
above him was a small point of land. By going<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
into the water from the end of this, he would
be some distance above the island he wished to
gain, and the current, would, therefore, carry
him down.</p>

<p>"If I only could get a log or something,"
thought the boy; "it wouldn't take me long to
get over there."</p>

<p>He started to hunt for a log that would suit
his requirements; but logs didn't seem very
plentiful in that vicinity. In his search, he re&euml;ntered
the woods, and after looking about a bit
succeeded in finding one that would just suit his
purpose.</p>

<p>Stooping down, he lifted it, and then jumped
back with a startled exclamation. A huge black
snake had been coiled under the log, and now
it struck at him, hissing and darting its red
tongue in and out, and showing its vicious
fangs!</p>

<p>Before Rob could avoid the creature's attack,
it had wrapped itself around his arm, fastening
its fangs into his sleeve.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 321px;">
<img src="images/i005.jpg" width="321" height="450" alt="HE TOPPLED BACKWARD OVER THE BRINK AND PLUNGED DOWN INTO THE SWIFTLY FLOWING CURRENT BENEATH." title="" />
<span class="caption">HE TOPPLED BACKWARD OVER THE BRINK AND PLUNGED DOWN INTO THE SWIFTLY FLOWING CURRENT BENEATH.</span>
</div>

<p>Rob battled desperately with the reptile, which
lashed its tail and hissed with vicious intonations.
The feel of the creature's grip was loathsome
to the boy, and although its fangs had not
penetrated his tough khaki coat, they might do
so at any moment.</p>

<p>In the battle Rob backed out of the woods,
striving all the time to free himself, and unconsciously
stepped nearer and nearer to the water's
edge. Before he realized his position he toppled
backward over the brink and plunged down into
the swiftly flowing current beneath.</p>

<p>Down he went until it seemed he must strike
the bottom! But his fall into the channel had
had one good effect. The snake was not gripping
his arm any more. When he shot to the
surface he saw it swimming for its life, but
being carried away from the shore.</p>

<p>In fact, the same thing was the case with Rob.
The grip of the water drew him far from the
island he had just vacated in such an unceremonious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
manner, and hurried him toward the
spot of land where he had seen the boat. Striking
out with all his might, the lad fought the
current so as to reach the other island before the
water hurried him past it. It was a hard fight
even for a powerful swimmer like Rob. His
clothes encumbered him cruelly, too; but at
last, almost exhausted, he touched bottom and
reeled ashore.</p>

<p>For a time he could do nothing but lie there
gasping. Had his life depended on it, he could
not have moved hand or foot. But at length
his youthful vitality came to his aid and he rose
to his feet to look about him.</p>

<p>The current had landed him on a part of the
beach from which the boat he had spied was not
visible. But he knew in which direction it lay,
and started out for it. As he rounded a small
promontory he came upon it, a heavily-built,
rickety-looking old thing, but still a boat.</p>

<p>Rob in his present situation would have taken
anything that would float.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll examine it first and then go hunt up the
owner and make a bargain with him for it," he
thought.</p>

<p>With this intention he approached the craft,
and the next instant received one of the cruellest
shocks of his life.</p>

<p>The boat was a mere shell, falling to pieces
from age and exposure to the hot sun. It must
have been years since she had been used, and
Rob's experienced eye saw that she would have
sunk like a stone the instant she was put in the
water. It was a bitter blow to the lad, and for a
time he sank down on the sand, completely
knocked out.</p>

<p>But after a time he rallied his spirits.</p>

<p>"After all," he mused, "there may be somebody
living on the island and that boat may be
just an old one they have discarded. I'll dry
my clothes and then start out to investigate."</p>

<p>With the drying of his clothes, Rob made an
alarming discovery. The food he had taken was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
most of it reduced to pulp by its immersion,
some canned goods alone remaining edible.</p>

<p>"That makes it all the more urgent for me to
find some aid," he said to himself; "I don't think
that bunch on the motor boat will trouble to
look for me. I guess they'd be glad to leave
me here if this is a deserted island. In that
case, I might die here before aid came."</p>

<p>But thrusting all such thoughts as that aside,
Rob determined to meet the situation like a
brave Scout.</p>

<p>"I won't give up till I'm at the last ditch," he
said to himself with determination, as he put on
his clothes. "I'll fight it out to the end."</p>

<p>Somehow this resolution of his made the boy
feel better. With renewed courage he set out
to explore the island. But he made the circuit
of it in vain. There was not a trace to be found
of human habitation nor any indication, except
the stranded, sun-dried boat, that anyone but
himself had ever landed there.</p>

<p>So despondent did he feel over this discovery<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
that had he possessed the strength to do so, he
would have swum back to the other island and
thrown himself on the mercy of his recent captors.
But this was now out of the question.</p>

<p>Unless he could find some way out of his
dilemma, it looked as if he would indeed be
doomed to leave his bones on those sands. The
thought was a dreadful one, and although it
was a warm, almost tropical day, the boy shivered
and cold sweat ran down his face.</p>

<p>If he were indeed to die there, nobody would
ever know his fate, in all probability. He had
failed in his mission to recover the papers, too.
Altogether he felt in a very miserable frame of
mind. It was in this mood that, in order to keep
his mind off his predicament, more than anything
else, he fell to examining the old boat again.
There might be some way to patch her up, he
thought desperately, hoping against hope.</p>

<p>Suddenly he made a discovery that set his
heart to beating wildly. On the stern board of
the boat was cut the name "<i>Good Hope!</i>"</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>

<h3>THE DEAD MAN'S HOARD.</h3>


<p>The "<i>Good Hope!</i>"</p>

<p>What a crowd of memories the name brought
buzzing about the boy! The lone derelict, the
figure in the mouldering cabin, the&mdash;the plan in
his pocket!</p>

<p>With fingers that trembled Rob drew out the
solution of the cryptogram and read it over.</p>

<p>Then he held his head in his hands a moment
to keep it from whirling round.</p>

<p>Could it be possible that this was the island
where the hoard of century-old ivory was buried?
Had he stumbled by a complete accident upon
the cache that had sent one man to his death?</p>

<p>Then he recalled that on his trip of exploration<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
he had noticed a big dead cypress on the other
side of the island. But if this was the veritable
island where the whalers had buried their
ivory, why was the boat lying there mouldering
on the beach? Why had they not left again?</p>

<p>The more the boy thought of it, the more mysterious
and inexplicable the whole thing became.
He resolved to go back to the dead cypress and
follow the directions of the cryptic message of
the captain of the <i>Good Hope</i>.</p>

<p>As has been said, the island was not a large
one, and he was not long in reaching the gaunt,
dead tree. Somehow he felt a chill go through
him as he stood beneath its leafless gray limbs.
It reminded him oddly of that skeleton in the
deck house of the derelict.</p>

<p>But he pulled himself together and struck off
into the woods in a direction that, by using his
watch as a compass, he knew to be the west. The
undergrowth was thick, but after going a few
paces, he reached an open space.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>In the centre of this was a sight that made his
heart jump and then beat wildly. Strewn in
every direction were big tusks of yellow ivory,
evidently lying just as they had been dug from
the ground.</p>

<p>Rob was still contemplating them when his
eye caught the flutter of a rag of cloth at the
edge of the open space. Attracted by a curiosity
he could not account for, he made his way
toward it. If the sight of the ivory had made
him jump, what he now saw sent a chill of horror
down his spine. The rag that had fluttered
had been part of the clothing of what had once
been two men.</p>

<p>Both lay close together, their bones showing
where the cloth had worn away under Time's
finger. A pair of rusty pistols lying by each
showed how they had come to their death. The
whole tragedy was as clear to Rob as if he had
seen it:&mdash;the quarrel between the two ivory
stealers, the duel with the pistols, and the death<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
of both combatants beside the treasure pile they
had done so much wickedness to acquire.</p>

<p>"Truly that figure in the deck house is
avenged," thought Rob, gazing with horror-stricken
eyes at the things before him. "Death
was indeed the wages of sin in their case."</p>

<p>Turning from the grisly relics of that far-off
duel on the lonely island, Rob fell to examining
the ivory. There was a large quantity of it.</p>

<p>"It must be worth an immense sum," he
thought.</p>

<p>But in the very moment of his triumph, Rob
suddenly recollected what, in his excitement, he
had entirely forgotten for the moment. He was
a castaway on a strange, uninhabited island, with
only a few tins of beef between him and starvation.
Thirst he did not fear, for close to where
he had struggled ashore was a spring of sweet,
cool water.</p>

<p>Rob made his way back to the beach and the
boat. Inside the boat he now noticed what had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
hitherto escaped his attention. There were several
hundred feet of light rope which seemed to
be still in fairly good condition. There was, too,
a pair of oars. At the same moment the boy was
seized by a sudden idea. He could get away
from the island, and in a boat, too!</p>

<p>His Boy Scout training had made him fertile
in ideas, and if the present one succeeded it
would mean his escape from a terrible fate.</p>

<div class='center'><big><b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</b></big></div>


<p>Ensign Hargreaves and Mr. Barr looked
sternly at each other.</p>

<p>"There is only one man who could have taken
that lever," said the ensign.</p>

<p>"And that is who?"</p>

<p>"The rascal Barton."</p>

<p>"But for what possible object?"</p>

<p>"I cannot think unless he has hidden it and
will only give it up as the price of his liberty."</p>

<p>"But if he keeps us down here, he will die,
too."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>"He is playing his life against ours and he
holds the cards."</p>

<p>"Not for long. Come below at once. We
must act quickly. There is a chance he still has
it on his person."</p>

<p>Down the stairs they ran, leaving Merritt at
the wheel with a sinking feeling of fear clutching
at his heart. If Barton, turned desperate,
had hidden the key and would not reveal its hiding
place, it meant that they must remain in the
depths till death put an end to their sufferings.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the ensign and Mr. Barr,
both excited, had rushed through the cabin and
toward the engine room. As they approached
the door, it was slammed and a pistol thrust
through a small hole in it, which had been cut
for ventilation.</p>

<p>Then Barton's voice came ringing out:</p>

<p>"Don't come a step closer unless you want to
get a bullet in you."</p>

<p>"What's the matter, man, are you mad?" exclaimed
Mr. Barr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>A shriek of demoniacal laughter was the sole
response.</p>

<p>It sent a shudder through everyone who heard
it. The man was mad, violently insane. The
seeds of lunacy, which had been germinating in
his brain for a long time, had burst forth into
a terrible harvest.</p>

<p>"And on that man everyone of our lives depends,"
breathed the ensign.</p>

<p>Then in a louder tone, which rang with authority:</p>

<p>"Barton, did you take that ascending lever?"</p>

<p>"Yes; ha-ha-ha! It's a good joke on you!
You thought you'd put me in prison, but now
we'll all die together."</p>

<p>"Barton," pleaded Mr. Barr, "be rational.
Return that lever and you shall have immunity."</p>

<p>"It's too late now!" screamed the demented
wretch. "We'll all die together in the depths of
the sea, where dead men's bones rot and the fish
eat their eyes out."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>A hasty consultation followed between the ensign
and Mr. Barr. The man was undoubtedly
violently insane, and there didn't seem a chance
in the world of dislodging him from his position.</p>

<p>The situation was the more serious from the
fact that the fresh air devices were not working
properly and the air inside the submarine
was already getting noticeably stale and foul.</p>

<p>"We must rush that door; it's our only
chance," declared the officer in a whispered
voice.</p>

<p>"But he is liable to shoot," objected Mr.
Barr, eying the blued-steel muzzle of the revolver
which was pointed threateningly at them.</p>

<p>"It cannot be helped. It means death in a fearful
form if we do not dislodge him from that
position, and a man in his condition cannot
listen to reason."</p>

<p>"Well, what do you propose?"</p>

<p>"That you start talking to him to distract his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
attention, offer him money or anything to give
up the lever. Then I'll watch my chance and
rush in on him; thank goodness, that door has
no lock on it."</p>

<p>"Barton!" said Mr. Barr, in a resonant voice.</p>

<p>"Well?" snarled the lunatic.</p>

<p>"Be calm now and listen to reason. Is it
money you wish?"</p>

<p>"No, blood! Human lives!" shrieked the
maniac.</p>

<p>At precisely that instant, like a projectile from
a gun the ensign's powerful body shot forward.
Crash came his solid one hundred and
eighty-five pounds against the door.</p>

<p>At the same instant there was another crash,
the sharp crack of a revolver! In that confined
space it sounded terribly loud.</p>

<p>"He's shot him!" cried Mr. Barr.</p>

<p>But Barton had done nothing of the kind.
The attack had been utterly unexpected by him,
and as the door banged against him with terrific<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
force, he had been knocked down. As he
fell the revolver exploded; before he could pull
the trigger a second time the powerful young
officer of Uncle Sam's Navy was upon the man.
Barton fought like a wildcat, and with the superhuman
strength of those afflicted with insanity.</p>

<p>At last, however, he was overpowered and,
raving incoherently, was tied hand and foot and
carried out to the cabin where he was placed on
a lounge. Mr. Barr, who knew something of
medicine, gave him a calming dose from the submarine's
medicine chest, and he became less violent.</p>

<p>"Barton, where did you put that lever?" demanded
the ensign.</p>

<p>The man whimpered like a child.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't remember," he gasped out.</p>

<p>Consternation showed on every face. Already
the air was getting worse and worse.</p>

<p>The ensign bent over the bound man, who was
now crying weakly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>"You must remember, man. You must, I
say!" he snapped, in tones that cut like the crack
of a whip. "Think! think! our lives depend upon
it!"</p>

<p>"If I knew, I would tell you," murmured the
man; "but I don't. I don't remember."</p>

<p>A stillness like death itself settled on the occupants
of the cabin. Barton had accomplished
his insane purpose only too well, it seemed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>

<h3>WHICH WILL WIN?</h3>


<p>Rob's idea was a simple enough one. With
his knife he would cut bundles of branches and
then bind them to the sides of the boat with the
rope. This would at least keep the crazy craft
afloat and offer him a means of reaching the
shore.</p>

<p>He set to work at once with great enthusiasm,
and by dusk his strange-looking boat was ready
to be launched. By placing round branches
under it for rollers and using another branch
as a lever, he soon succeeded in getting it into
the water. But it was hard work, and he paused
to eat some of his canned beef before going any
further.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>To his huge delight the boat, though lopsided
and half full of water, was buoyed up by the
branches, and he had no doubt that he could
navigate her with the oars. As soon as he had
finished his unappetizing meal, Rob clambered
on board his "ark," as he mentally called her,
and thrust the oars into the rowlocks. The boat
was very heavy, and owing to her waterlogged
condition pulled very hard. Worse still, Rob
encountered a current that carried him toward
the other island, the one he had left that morning;
and even worse, a fact he presently perceived,
his craft was being carried around a
point, on the opposite side of which he could see
the glow of a fire against the night sky; for by
this time it was dark. Rob was heartily glad
that this was the case, for he knew that the fire
must be that of the rascals who had abducted
him, and in the darkness he might slip by them
unnoticed.</p>

<p>Luckily the current set a bit from the shore at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
this point, and although the boy could hear the
three rascals carousing around their fire over a
keg of spirits, and singing and shouting at the
top of their voices, they could not see him, partly
because of their condition, and partly because of
the firelight.</p>

<p>Past the camp, with its carousing inmates, the
boy was carried, and suddenly his boat was
bumped against something. Rob looked around.
At first he thought he had struck a rock. Instead
he saw before him the green motor boat.</p>

<p>Like a flash an inspiration came to him. He
clambered on board, and not till he was fairly
on deck did he recollect that he had neglected to
tie his ark to the side.</p>

<p>He looked over the stern rail. In the dim
light he could see his clumsy craft drifting off,
bobbing up and down on the tide.</p>

<p>"Well, I've burned my bridges behind me
now," he exclaimed to himself. "If I can't carry
this thing through, I'll be cold meat by morning."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>Just at that moment came a shout from the
outlaws carousing on the beach.</p>

<p>Keener-eyed than his companions, Berghoff
had spied a dark form on the motor boat, silhouetted
against the thickly sprinkled stars.</p>

<p>"There's someone stealing our boat. After
him, boys!" Rob heard the fellow roar.</p>

<p>Then he ducked as a volley of bullets came
whizzing over his head. His next move was to
clamber forward, keeping as low as possible till
he reached the anchor chain.</p>

<p>There was no time to haul in, for the men had
already run down the beach and launched their
small boat.</p>

<p>Rob merely knocked out a shackle pin and
let the whole thing go. This done, he scrambled
back and descended to the engine room.</p>

<p>"If I can't make this old tea-kettle go, I'm
a gone coon," he admitted to himself with grim
humor, as he switched on gasoline and spark,
and turned the fly wheel over.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
Outside the shouts were coming closer every
instant, and the motor showed no signs of intending
to start.</p>

<div class='center'><big><b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</b></big></div>


<p>It was Donald, the Wolf Scout, who saved the
day for the prisoners of the submarine.</p>

<p>As Barton rolled about whimpering and cursing
by turns, he spied a bright object protruding
from the man's pocket.</p>

<p>"Is&mdash;is that the lever?" he asked, in tones that
trembled with excitement.</p>

<p>Mr. Barr darted on the object and pulled it
out with a shout of triumph.</p>

<p>"Once more the Boy Scouts have saved the
day!" he cried. "It is the lever, sure enough!"</p>

<p>Close as the atmosphere of the cabin had by
this time become, they all found breath enough
to give three ringing cheers. In the conning
tower Merritt, at the wheel, heard them, and
guessed what they meant.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later the submarine was shooting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
upward to the surface toward the blessed air.
With what speed the hatch was opened when
they reached the surface and could inhale the
pure ozone once more, may be imagined. As
soon as they had somewhat recovered a red light
was shown from the stern, and presently the
<i>Viper</i> came chugging up.</p>

<p>"Well, where in the world have you been?"
asked Tubby.</p>

<p>"Where <i>under</i> the world, you mean," laughed
Merritt; "but for a time it was no laughing matter,
I assure you."</p>

<p>He then gave his fellow Scout a description
of all they had undergone. When the excitement
was over, word was given to get under
way once more, and with the submarine leading,
and the <i>Viper</i> following the red light, they held
their courses toward the south.</p>

<p>It was dawn when they found themselves off
a maze of small islands and islets. Donald had
the wheel, and was gazing ahead as the submarine,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
at reduced speed, threaded her way
among the shoals and sand bars.</p>

<p>All at once he saw something coming toward
them that made his pulses beat far above normal.</p>

<p>It was a green motor boat, with a single military
mast and a high cabin.</p>

<p>He lost no time in notifying everybody, and
the submarine decks were soon crowded.</p>

<p>"Better get below, boys," warned the ensign;
"that is undoubtedly the rascals' boat. In fact,
Merritt says he recognizes it. They are desperate
fellows, and when they see we have them
cornered, they will put up a fight. If they run,
I mean to pursue them to the bitter end."</p>

<p>Reluctantly the boys went below, while the
ensign and Mr. Barr stood on the foredeck, revolvers
in hand.</p>

<p>But although whoever was on the green boat
must have seen them, the craft came right on.</p>

<p>"Why, they actually mean to fight," gasped
Mr. Barr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>"They're nervy fellows, all right," commented
the ensign; "we may have a tougher time of it
than we think, Barr."</p>

<p>He turned and warned Tubby to take his boat
back out of range. On and on came the green
boat without making a sign of any kind, hostile
or otherwise.</p>

<p>"What can they be up to?" wondered the ensign
in tones of blank amazement.</p>

<p>Scarcely twenty feet intervened between the
two boats now, when suddenly a boyish figure,
bareheaded and clad in a Boy Scout uniform,
leaped to the rail of the green craft.</p>

<p>"Kre-ee-ee-ee!" he shrilled out.</p>

<p>"The call of the Eagle Patrol!" gasped Mr.
Barr.</p>

<p>"Yes, and by all that's wonderful, that lad is
Rob Blake!" fairly shouted the ensign, waving
his cap.</p>

<p>By this time Tubby, too, had recognized his
leader. The air rang with cheers, shouts, questions
and answers in a perfect babble of sound.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, who on earth but a Boy Scout could
get himself kidnapped and then kidnap his abductors'
boat!" exclaimed the ensign that evening
as they lay at anchor off Rob's "Ivory Island."</p>

<p>The climax of a wonderful day had been
reached. Only one thing marred it. The rascals
who had pursued Rob, for he only got the engine
going in the nick of time, had got clear away in
the rowboat. Possibly they hailed a passing
steamer and were picked up.</p>

<p>But, after all, their escape, while annoying,
was not of so much importance, for in their
haste they had left behind the most important
papers and models, and the ones they had taken
were valueless, Mr. Barr declared, without the
missing ones.</p>

<p>The next day, after a long evening of jollity,
the <i>Viper</i> set out for Jamesport, S. C., with the
unfortunate Barton bound with ropes to keep
him from further violent manifestations. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
poor man never recovered his reason, but died
shortly after being admitted to an asylum. It
appeared that in his youth he had been an inmate
of an institution for the feeble-minded, but
had been discharged as cured.</p>

<p>On the <i>Viper's</i> return, work was begun on
transferring the ivory, which was ultimately sold
for an amount that netted all of them a handsome
sum; for Rob insisted on sharing his good
fortune with all his comrades.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>

<h3>THE ENDURANCE RUN.</h3>


<p>The ensuing days, following the return to
the island, were filled to overflowing with activity.
Exhaustive tests only made the <i>Peacemaker</i>
appear to be more and more the ideal
type of boat for her particular work. By means
of the island wireless Ensign Hargreaves, using
"code" of course, sent glowing accounts to
Washington of the progress of the tests. In
these despatches, too, the Boy Scouts were favorably
mentioned for their pluck and heroism
in the pursuit of Berghoff and his rascally companions.</p>

<p>One day, about two weeks after the return to
the island, it was determined by the ensign and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
Mr. Barr to make quite a run out to sea to test
to the full the endurance capacity of the <i>Peacemaker</i>.
Rob and Merritt were chosen to accompany
them. The rest of the boys were left
to guard the island, which, among other valuable
property, now housed the precious ivory hoard
recovered in such a strange manner.</p>

<p>The day dawned with a red, angry sky proclaiming
nasty weather. But this, instead of
dampening the ardor of the inventor and his
aides, only increased it. It meant that the submarine
was in for a real test in a bad sea.</p>

<p>By the time they were ready to start, the wind
had freshened into half a gale and a high sea
was running, heaping up big gray combers with
white tops which broke angrily.</p>

<p>Into this storm the <i>Peacemaker</i> was headed
without hesitation. On board were the ensign,
the inventor, Rob and Merritt. The two latter
were to serve watch and watch in the engine
room, while the inventor and the ensign placed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
themselves under a similar arrangement in the
conning tower.</p>

<p>Both Rob and Merritt were by this time fully
conversant with the running of the <i>Peacemaker's</i>
intricate machinery and were trusted to the full
by their superior officers.</p>

<p>"Gee! This feels like being afloat in an empty
bottle!" exclaimed Merritt as the <i>Peacemaker</i>
headed into the tumbling seas.</p>

<p>"It sure does," responded Rob, hanging on to
a handhold while he oiled a bearing. "I suppose
they want to see how much she'll stand on
the surface."</p>

<p>"Wonder they wouldn't dive and give us a
chance to get a little quiet," observed Merritt as
the rolling, bucking <i>Peacemaker</i> leaped, as it
seemed, skyward and then plunged dizzily down
again.</p>

<p>"There must be a hummer of a sea outside.
Guess, as I'm off duty, I'll go up and see what's
doing," said Rob presently.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>He made his way with much difficulty toward
the steel ladder leading into the conning tower.
The passage could only be made by fits and
starts, and the boy for the first time realized the
necessity of the handholds placed at frequent intervals
on the cabin walls, to which reference has
already been made.</p>

<p>Reaching the ladder he scrambled up into the
conning tower, and, once inside, braced himself
against the wild and erratic motions of the
<i>Peacemaker</i>. To see through the lenses was impossible.
The seas that swept over the little craft
blurred the glass with green water and obscured
everything outside. But on the <i>Peacemaker</i> this
condition did not matter. The contingency had
been provided for.</p>

<p>The long arm of the periscope with its "eye"
on top had been raised, and it reached far above
the biggest combers. In front of the helmsman,
who happened to be Mr. Barr, was a big
plate of ground glass on which every object outside<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
was plainly shown, although of course in
miniature. Those of my readers who have ever
seen a "camera obscura" will recognize what I
mean.</p>

<p>Upon the ground glass, as within a picture
frame, was reproduced the motion of the furious
seas, the scurrying clouds and the angry storm
wrack. It was an inspiring marine painting,
with the motion and sweep that an actual painting
could never possess. It thrilled Rob as he
gazed at it and realized that it was through this
pandemonium of the storm that the <i>Peacemaker</i>
was bravely fighting her way.</p>

<p>"Better slow down a bit, hadn't I?" asked Mr.
Barr as the <i>Peacemaker</i>, urged by her powerful
engines, ploughed right through a mountainous
sea.</p>

<p>As she bored her way through the mighty wall
of green water, a roar like that of a railroad
train resounded and the craft pitched as if she
were going to plunge to the bottom of the sea.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
This latter, in fact, Rob rather wished she
would do. He knew that in the depths all
would be quiet and undisturbed.</p>

<p>In reply to Mr. Barr's question, the ensign
nodded.</p>

<p>"The strain is already pretty strong," he
said; "we don't want to force her too hard."</p>

<p>Accordingly the inventor, utilizing the auto
control device, cut down the speed till, instead
of ploughing through the waves, the <i>Peacemaker</i>
skimmed over them. Unlike most submarines,
which cannot do otherwise than
plunge into heavy seas, the <i>Peacemaker's</i> hull
was so constructed that she rode the waves
like a duck.</p>

<p>After a while the sensation of heaving and
falling began to get upon Mr. Barr's nerves.</p>

<p>"I'm feeling a bit squeamish," he declared;
"let's dive and get out of this."</p>

<p>The ensign nodded and laughed.</p>

<p>"Our friend Rob here is getting a bit pale,
too," he said; "and as we don't want a sea-sick<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
crew, maybe we had better seek the seclusion of
Davy Jones' locker."</p>

<p>An instant later the <i>Peacemaker</i> was plunging
downward. At a depth of twenty feet the
angry motion of the waves was unfelt. In those
dim depths all was as quiet and undisturbed as if
the elements were at perfect peace above.</p>

<p>Down, down dropped the submarine till her
depth indicator showed that she was submerged
five hundred fathoms.</p>

<p>"The chart gives seven hundred hereabouts,"
commented Ensign Hargreaves, glancing at it;
"so I guess we are safe for forty miles more before
the floor of the ocean slopes upward. We
must go up a bit higher then."</p>

<p>The inventor nodded.</p>

<p>"I understand," he said, and then, "we are
now running at what speed?"</p>

<p>The ensign turned to the speed indicator.</p>

<p>"A trifle under twenty miles an hour," he said.</p>

<p>Mr. Barr glanced at the clock before him,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
which was illuminated by a tiny shaded electric
bulb.</p>

<p>"I'll keep on this course at this speed for about
two hours then," he determined.</p>

<p>"That will be all right, I imagine," was the rejoinder,
"but don't keep on too long. The bed
of the sea, according to the chart, rises up very
rapidly further on. It must be almost cliff-like
in its sudden elevation."</p>

<p>"I'll be on the lookout," the inventor assured
him.</p>

<p>Rob descended the ladder once more and re&euml;ntered
the engine room to find out how Merritt
was getting along. He found the young engineer
seated on the leather lounge alongside the
engines watching them lovingly.</p>

<p>"Work smoothly, don't they?" he said.</p>

<p>"They sure do," was the other's response;
"smoothly as a Geneva watch."</p>

<p>The boys sat chatting on various matters, and
the time flew along rapidly till Rob suddenly
looked at his watch.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>"Almost two hours. It's time we were rising,"
he said.</p>

<p>"What do we want to rise for? It's deep
enough here, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"That's just it. The ensign says that the chart
shows that a sort of submarine cliff looms up
right ahead of us somewhere hereabouts."</p>

<p>"Great ginger snaps! I thought the bottom of
the sea was as level as a floor."</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it. It's as full of mountainous
regions and flat, depressed plains and valleys as
the Rockies themselves."</p>

<p>"Gee whiz! I'd hate to hit one of them.
I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Merritt stopped short. A terrific crash shook
the submarine from stem to stern. Rob saved
himself from falling into the machinery by seizing
a rail.</p>

<p>For an instant the vibration lasted, and then
the diving craft came to a dead stop.</p>

<p>The boys gazed at each other with blanched
faces.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>Did the crash mean that they had actually
struck one of the submerged ranges that make
deep sea traveling full of dangers? Had Mr.
Barr delayed too long in rising?</p>

<p>On the answer to these questions both boys
felt that their lives depended.</p>

<p>They were still regarding each other with consternation
when the ensign burst into the cabin.</p>

<p>"Shut off the engines instantly!" he ordered.</p>

<p>"What have we struck? That submerged cliff
that you feared?" Rob managed to gasp out,
while Merritt hastened to obey the officer's command.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't know," was the reply, "but I fear
that we are in serious danger!"</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>

<h3>THE SUPREME TEST.</h3>


<p>"Open the side window panel and turn on the
searchlight!"</p>

<p>The order came from Mr. Barr five minutes
after the <i>Peacemaker</i> struck. Naturally enough,
everyone on board was seriously alarmed; but
in the face of danger the Boy Scouts took their
example for action from the naval officer and
the inventor.</p>

<p>Although deadly pale, Mr. Barr kept his voice
as cool as an icicle. Ensign Hargreaves, while
fully realizing the danger, yet steeled himself to
calmness; and both Rob and Merritt simulated
the courage of their elders.</p>

<p>Rob hastened to obey Mr. Barr's command.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
After a few seconds of manipulation the slide
drew back, exposing the large plate glass panel.
To bring the powerful searchlight into play was
the work of but a moment.</p>

<p>As its white rays pierced the gloomy depths
of the ocean like a scimitar of light, all on board
peered intently from the panel and strove to
make out what it was that the diving boat had
struck.</p>

<p>At first nothing could be seen but the dark
water with myriads of fish swarming about the
bright light, which appeared to attract them as
moths are attracted to an arc light.</p>

<p>"Swing the light," ordered Mr. Barr; "bring it
to bear a little more forward."</p>

<p>Rob obeyed, and the ray of light swung in an
arc through the obscurity outside of the <i>Peacemaker</i>.
All at once, with a sharp exclamation,
Rob stopped it.</p>

<p>"Look! look!" he cried, pointing from the window.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>They looked and saw before them what appeared
to be a steep acclivity, ribbed and rocky
as a mountain side. It was against this submerged
cliff that the <i>Peacemaker</i> had struck.</p>

<p>"That submarine cliff appears to be of a soft
formation," declared the ensign after a brief
scrutiny; "our bow has driven into it."</p>

<p>"Then we are doomed to remain here?" asked
Merritt with a bit of a quiver in his voice.</p>

<p>"Not necessarily. It's up to us now to do all
we can to extricate ourselves."</p>

<p>"But how?"</p>

<p>The question came from Rob, whose voice, try
as he would, persisted in faltering. It was an
awful feeling to experience, this of being penned
scores of fathoms beneath the ocean's surface in
a diving boat.</p>

<p>"Well, I have a plan in mind. It is a desperate
one, but possibly it may work."</p>

<p>"What do you propose to do?"</p>

<p>This time it was the inventor who propounded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
the query. Clearly enough Mr. Barr himself
could think of no way out of the quandary.</p>

<p>"I don't care to say just yet," responded the
naval officer.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because it is a sort of forlorn hope that I
don't care to advocate until absolute necessity
arises."</p>

<p>In the dire extremity into which they were
plunged, not one of them cared just then to waste
time by asking questions. Clearly Uncle Sam's
officer was at the head of affairs. In silence they
awaited his next word.</p>

<p>"Rob, you must reverse the engines. Give
them all the power they will stand. It's just
possible that we may be able to back out without
injury, although I fear that we are pretty deeply
buried in this cliff."</p>

<p>Rob, accompanied by Merritt, hastened to
obey. Together the two boys entered the engine
room, and Rob at once operated the mechanism
which caused the <i>Peacemaker</i> to go backward.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>As he pulled over the lever and the engines began
to whirr and buzz, everyone on the boat
waited breathlessly for the result. But the
<i>Peacemaker</i> did not move. Under the strain of
her laboring engines the steel fabric shook and
chattered, but not an inch did the diving boat
budge.</p>

<p>Rob and Merritt exchanged despairing
glances.</p>

<p>"Can't you get any more power out of her?"
asked Merritt anxiously.</p>

<p>Rob shook his head.</p>

<p>"Not a bit more, old man. She's running at
her utmost now."</p>

<p>"Then we're stuck?"</p>

<p>"It looks that way."</p>

<p>"And we're doomed to die right here unless
the nose of the boat can be got out of that cliff!"</p>

<p>"Never say, 'die,' Merritt. We've done the
best we can, and remember the ensign said that
he had a plan if all else failed."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, 'a forlorn hope' he called it."</p>

<p>"In a case like this we can endure anything.
Desperate situations require desperate means to
solve them."</p>

<p>As the young Scout leader spoke, Ensign Hargreaves
burst into the engine room.</p>

<p>The engines were still whirring and buzzing,
and the hull of the <i>Peacemaker</i> was quivering
under their powerful stress.</p>

<p>"Have you developed every ounce of power
they are capable of?" asked the naval officer.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," responded Rob respectfully; "they
can't do another revolution."</p>

<p>The officer looked anxious.</p>

<p>"In that case, we shall have to resort to my
forlorn hope," he said.</p>

<p>"And what is that, sir?" asked Rob, his heart
beating uncomfortably fast.</p>

<p>"Come forward and you shall see."</p>

<p>The ensign turned and swung out of the engine
room, followed closely by two anxious boys,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
Rob having waited only to shut off the engines.</p>

<p>In the main cabin Mr. Barr, his face white
and strained, sat on one of the leather divans.</p>

<p>He looked up as the boys and the naval officer
entered.</p>

<p>"The engines won't back her out?" he asked
in a voice harsh and rough from anxiety.</p>

<p>"No. I'm sorry, Barr, but we're in a mighty
bad fix. This submarine cliff must be of a sort
of blue clay formation that is common off this
coast. We have apparently driven into it so far
that nothing short of an earthquake would dislodge
us."</p>

<p>"An earthquake?"</p>

<p>"Yes; such a spasm of nature alone can set us
free."</p>

<p>"Then we are doomed to remain here."</p>

<p>"Not of necessity; we have still a chance of
escape."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"That my plan offers a mere chance."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then let us not delay in putting it into execution."</p>

<p>"But it is a dangerous one!"</p>

<p>"Never mind that. Nothing could be more
serious than our present predicament."</p>

<p>"Very well then, we will try out my idea. It's
our last chance."</p>

<p>"Our last chance!" The words sounded to the
boys almost like a requiem. Plainly enough,
whatever Ensign Hargreaves' plan might be,
there were dangers attached to it, and no light
dangers, either, to judge from his grave tones.
Eagerly they awaited his next words.</p>

<p>"My plan is nothing more nor less than this,"
he said; "I propose to create an earthquake."</p>

<p>"To <i>create</i> an earthquake!" Mr. Barr echoed
the words, staring at the ensign as if he thought
he had gone suddenly insane.</p>

<p>"Precisely. I intend to produce by artificial
means an eruption which will destroy enough of
this cliff to set us free, or else blow the <i>Peacemaker</i>
herself into atoms."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Barr buried his head in his hands. Skillful
inventor and scientific expert though he was,
the last words of the naval officer had sapped
even his iron courage.</p>

<p>"Is there no other way?"</p>

<p>"No other way. It's a gamble for our lives."</p>

<p>"What do you propose doing?" asked Mr.
Barr in a strange, broken voice.</p>

<p>"As I said, to create an artificial earthquake."</p>

<p>"I am unable to follow you."</p>

<p>"Then I'll make it clearer. In the torpedo
compartment forward you have six Red Head
torpedoes fully charged with gun cotton?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>The inventor was regarding the naval officer
with intense interest now, and the boys also stood
transfixed, their eyes riveted on the ensign as
he unfolded his plan.</p>

<p>"What I propose to do," he continued, "is to
discharge from the side torpedo tubes two torpedoes.
They will be aimed at the cliff and, of
course, when they strike it, will explode."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>"But in that case our bow would be blown off
also, and we should perish almost instantly," declared
Mr. Barr.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute. I didn't say we would discharge
them <i>directly</i> at the cliff. What I propose
doing is this: We will aim one on each side
of the spot where our bow drove in, taking care
to train the tubes so that the torpedoes will not
strike too near."</p>

<p>"Yes, the tubes are movable. That is one of
the features of the <i>Peacemaker</i>."</p>

<p>"Very well, then, they will be as easy to train
in any desired direction as a rapid fire gun."</p>

<p>"Exactly. But I never thought when I designed
them that I might some day owe my life
to that very feature."</p>

<p>"Well, we are by no means out of the woods
yet," responded the ensign drily.</p>

<p>He led the way to the forward torpedo room.
This was right in the bow of the boat and most
of the space was occupied by odd-looking machinery.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
Wheels, worm gears and strange-looking
levers were everywhere. At the farthest
end of the steel-walled chamber was a sort of
derrick contrivance. This was the piece of machinery
used to raise the torpedoes and swing
them into the tubes.</p>

<p>Like the other machinery on the <i>Peacemaker</i>,
the derrick was operated by electricity. A pull
of a lever and Mr. Barr had set its machinery in
motion. The torpedoes were placed on racks so
that it was a simple matter to secure them to the
lifting chain of the derrick. First one and then
another of the polished steel implements of
deadly warfare were raised to the mouths of the
torpedo tubes which projected into the chamber.</p>

<p>Despite their immense weight, the torpedoes
were placed within the tubes with no more difficulty
than a sportsman experiences in shoving
two cartridges into the breech of his gun.</p>

<p>In ten minutes from the time the party entered
the torpedo chamber, the steel implements of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
death had been "rammed home" and the breech
of the tubes clamped and fastened. On the
<i>Peacemaker</i> type of submarine compressed air
at an enormous pressure was used to give the
torpedoes a start, although, of course, they contained
the usual machinery within themselves to
drive them through the water after they left the
tubes.</p>

<p>There followed a moment of suspense as the
compressed air, with a hissing sound, rushed into
the tubes.</p>

<p>Mr. Barr, deadly pale but without a tremor in
his voice, announced that all was ready.</p>

<p>The ensign merely nodded and began to operate
a worm gear which swung the tubes at an
acuter angle to the body of the submarine vessel.</p>

<p>"I think we are all right now," he said presently.</p>

<p>"Very well," spoke the inventor, his hand on a
lever, "when you say the word, I'll discharge the
torpedoes."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>"You might as well do it right now," was the
response.</p>

<p>The inventor, with hands that shook, swung
the lever back.</p>

<p>There was a hissing sound and a slight tremor
as the compressed air shot the torpedoes from
the tubes. Less than a second later, simultaneously
it seemed, the submarine was rocked
and swayed by a terrific convulsion. The boys
and their elders were thrown right and left with
a force that almost knocked them senseless.</p>

<p>It was but a few moments after the explosion
of the two torpedoes that Ensign Hargreaves
uttered a shout that thrilled them all.</p>

<p>"We're rising!" he cried. "My plan succeeded
after all!"</p>

<p>"I think that we ought to give thanks to Providence,"
said Mr. Barr reverently. "As the ensign
has said, the plan succeeded, but it was taking
one chance in a thousand. Had that cliff not
been shaken so as to release us, we might have
perished miserably and left our fate a mystery."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>The boys were in the conning tower by the
conclusion of Mr. Barr's words. The barograph
showed them to be rising a hundred feet a minute.
No words were exchanged between the two
young Scouts, but each grasped the other's hand
in a firm grip and gazed into the other's eyes.
There was no necessity of speech. Both realized
that they had passed through the gravest peril
that even they had experienced in all their adventurous
lives.</p>

<p>When the <i>Peacemaker</i> reached the surface
once more, the storm had subsided. With their
hearts full of deep gratitude for the miraculous
chance that had saved their lives, her occupants
headed the speedy diving craft back for the island
at top speed. The <i>Peacemaker</i> had been
through the supreme test and had not been found
lacking.</p>

<p>"I tell you what, Barr," declared Ensign Hargreaves,
as they neared the familiar island, "you
have the most wonderful boat on earth, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
Uncle Sam has <i>got</i> to have it. My report goes
in to Washington to-morrow and you can guess
what it will contain."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said the inventor simply, extending
his hand.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>

<h3>INTO THE JAWS OF DEATH.</h3>


<p>"That's queer, Rob!"</p>

<p>"What's queer, Merritt, the way you've been
sitting and staring for the last ten minutes?"</p>

<p>"No; that odd noise. Don't you hear it?"</p>

<p>The two lads were seated in the cabin of the
submarine on "night guard duty," as it was
called. Following the anxious days when Berghoff
had made affairs on the island so filled with
uneasiness for the Scouts and their friends, this
sentry duty had been regularly maintained.</p>

<p>On this particular night the task had fallen to
Rob and Merritt. There was nothing very arduous
about it, the only duty involved being to keep
ears and eyes open. Both lads had been engrossed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
in books dealing with their favorite subjects
when Merritt called Rob's attention to the
odd sound he had noticed.</p>

<p>"Maybe my ears are not quite so sharp as
yours, old boy," said Rob, after an interval of
listening. "I've got a slight cold, anyhow, and
perhaps that's why I don't hear so readily."</p>

<p>"Possibly so."</p>

<p>"You are sure you weren't mistaken?"</p>

<p>"Think I'm hearing things?" indignantly responded
Merritt. "No, siree, I'm willing to
bet. Hark! There it is again!"</p>

<p>"By Hookey! I heard it that time, too. What
can it be?"</p>

<p>"Hush!"</p>

<p>The noise was a most peculiar one. It seemed
to be a sort of scraping on the outside of the submarine's
hull. The diving craft was anchored at
some distance from the shore, so as to be more
readily prepared for a projected run the following
day. This made the noise all the more inexplicable,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
as, had the craft been in the shed, it
might have been caused by the inventor or the
ensign paying a night visit to see that all was
well, which they sometimes did.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it's a log bumping against the side."</p>

<p>"No; it appears to come from under the
water."</p>

<p>"That's so," agreed Rob; "tell you what, Merritt,
it's up to us to investigate."</p>

<p>"Yes, let's go on deck and see what we can
find out."</p>

<p>Together the two lads climbed the steel stairway
leading to the conning tower, and presently
emerged on the rounded steel back of the diving
craft. They stood here for a minute or two, trying
to get their eyes used to the sudden change
from the bright light of the cabin to the inky
darkness of the night. It was overcast and starless,
and it was impossible under any condition
to see more than a few yards about them.</p>

<p>Suddenly Rob clasped Merritt's arm with a
grip that made the other lad wince.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>"Look! Look there!" he cried. "Off there.
It's gone now. It only showed up for an instant."</p>

<p>"It's your turn to be nervous," rejoined Merritt;
"blessed if I saw anything!"</p>

<p>"My eyes must be as sharp as your ears, then.
I'd swear I saw a shadowy thing sneak away
from us across the water."</p>

<p>"What sort of a thing?"</p>

<p>"A boat. I only saw it an instant, of course;
but I'm sure I wasn't mistaken."</p>

<p>"You think that somebody in that boat was
monkeying with the <i>Peacemaker?</i>"</p>

<p>"That's the only reasonable explanation."</p>

<p>"But what could they have been doing?"</p>

<p>"That remains to be seen; but it's our duty to
try to find out."</p>

<p>"What's your plan?"</p>

<p>"Well, that scraping noise appeared to me to
come from the under side of the hull."</p>

<p>"Yes."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then that's the place to look for mischief."</p>

<p>"But how are you going to get at it?"</p>

<p>"Dive over and feel around at about the place
where we heard the sound."</p>

<p>"That was on the port side and apparently
right under the cabin floor."</p>

<p>"Then that's the place to look."</p>

<p>As he spoke, the young leader of the Eagles
stripped off his shirt, for the night was warm
and he was coatless, and then divested himself
in turn of his shoes and trousers.</p>

<p>This done, he turned to Merritt.</p>

<p>"I don't know just why, old fellow," he said,
"but I've got an idea in my head, somehow, that
there's some sort of dirty trick being put up to-night."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>Merritt asked the question looking into his
comrade's eyes as he clasped Rob's extended
hand. For some reason he felt a cold shudder
run through him. What the danger was that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
Rob dreaded he did not know, but there was
something in the hand-shake that his leader gave
him that almost seemed like a farewell clasp.</p>

<p>Before his inquiry was fairly out of Merritt's
mouth, Rob had disengaged his palm and slipped
silently over the side of the submarine. As the
waters closed above him, Merritt almost cried
out aloud. The same mysterious sense of a danger,
terrible and imminent, had run through his
brain like a warning flash. But it was too late
to recall his comrade now.</p>

<p>Whatever peril Rob was facing, he was called
upon to brave it out alone.</p>

<div class='center'><b>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</b></div>

<p>Earlier that evening a small, but fast and
high-powered motor boat had glided almost
silently out of Bellport, a fishing village on the
coast, and, waiting till darkness had descended,
made at top speed for the vicinity of the submarine
island.</p>

<p>The men who had chartered the craft were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
two in number. Both were strangers in Bellport,
having driven over there that afternoon from
the adjacent railway station of Farmington. One
was an old man, stoop-shouldered and bleary-eyed.
The other was an individual of about
thirty, tall, emaciated, and with a wild light
dancing in his crafty eyes, which darted back
and forth as if constantly on the lookout for
something.</p>

<p>Going directly to the Bellport Hotel, they had
inquired of Enos Hardcastle, the proprietor,
where they could hire a motor boat.</p>

<p>"A fast one?" croaked the old man.</p>

<p>"The faster the better," supplemented his companion,
in a queer, rasping voice.</p>

<p>Enos scratched his head.</p>

<p>"Wa'al, motor boat's is scarce around here,
though some of ther boys uses 'em in fishing," he
said finally.</p>

<p>"Good!" exclaimed the younger of the pair of
strangers. "Direct us to the man who has the
fastest one."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's Lem Higgins; but Lem drives a hard
bargain. It'll cost ye&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind the cost; never mind the cost,"
croaked the old man impatiently. "Come, Ivan,
let's find this Higgins."</p>

<p>"You go ter ther foot of this street and you'll
find Lem down on ther wharf," directed the landlord
of the Bellport Hotel, whose curiosity was
by this time aroused. There was something odd
about the two strangers, almost as odd as the
large black bag the younger one carried. This
receptacle he held as gingerly as if it contained
some article of the most fragile description.</p>

<p>"Beg pardon, strangers," spoke up Enos, "but
what might you be after havin' in that bag?"</p>

<p>The slender man turned a pair of blazing orbs
on him.</p>

<p>"What business is that of yours?" he snapped
out, his queer eyes appearing to emit sparks of
malignant fury.</p>

<p>Enos hastened to extend the olive branch.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, no harm, no harm," he hurriedly exclaimed.
"I thought thet you two might be sellin'
suthin' the wife 'ud have a use fer, thet's all.
Wanted to give you a chancet ter drive a trade."</p>

<p>"I reckon your wife wouldn't care much for
what's in this bag," snarled the old man viciously;
"and let me give you a bit of advice, my
friend: Don't ask questions and you'll be told
no lies."</p>

<p>So saying, the two oddly assorted strangers
made off down the street, the tall one still carrying
the black bag with precise care.</p>

<p>Enos re&euml;ntered his hotel, wagging his head
sententiously.</p>

<p>"Suthin' queer about them two fellers," he
muttered to himself; "ain't sellin' nuthin' an' they
don't look as if they was on a pleasure trip.
Wa'al, it's none of my business, but if Lem
makes a dicker with 'em he'll hev ter come across
to me with a commission, an' that's all I care
about."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>Lem Higgins was sitting on the wharf, swinging
his legs and regarding with interest an imminent
fight between two dogs of the "yaller" variety,
when the old man and his tall companion
came up.</p>

<p>"Your name is Lem Higgins?" asked the old
man sharply.</p>

<p>"That's what they usually say when they want
me," responded Lem. "Do you want me?"</p>

<p>"We want your boat."</p>

<p>Lem's eyes lightened. Fishing had been poor,
and perhaps here was a chance to make some
easy money. He scrambled to his feet, showing
unusual animation.</p>

<p>"You want my boat? You want ter hire her,
you mean?"</p>

<p>"Yes. What's your figure?"</p>

<p>The old man was doing all the talking now.
His tall companion stood silently by. At his
side was the black bag, which he had deposited
on the ground with the same curious care that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
had marked all his dealings with the mysterious
article.</p>

<p>Lem ruminated a minute, looked seaward,
ejected a small fountain of tobacco juice,
and then asked, with his head cocked on one side:</p>

<p>"Where might you be a-goin'?"</p>

<p>"Never mind that, my friend. That is none
of your business."</p>

<p>The old man spoke sharply. Lem regarded
him blankly.</p>

<p>"None o' my business! Then how in Sam Hill
am I a-goin' ter run the boat?"</p>

<p>"You are not going to run it."</p>

<p>"I ain't, eh?"</p>

<p>Lem was all "taken back," as he would have
put it. He had been figuring on a good price
for the hire of the boat and a further fee for
himself as skipper. Certainly neither of the
pair before him looked capable of handling a
power boat.</p>

<p>"No; if we take your boat we shall run it
ourselves."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>"You will?"</p>

<p>The astonished Lem gazed at the stooped figure
before him. He was almost bereft of words.</p>

<p>"Yes, I will; does that satisfy you?"</p>

<p>"Wa'al, I'll be plumb dummed," choked out
the fisherman; "I should think you'd know more
about crutches an' arm-chairs than about running
gasoline boats."</p>

<p>"Your opinion is not of the slightest interest
to me. How much do you want for the boat?"</p>

<p>"Fer how long?"</p>

<p>"From about sunset till daylight to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Fer all night, you mean?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"That's a queer time to go out."</p>

<p>"Possibly; but we choose to do it. If you don't
want to let your boat, say so, and have done with
it. We'll find another."</p>

<p>"Oh, as far as thet's consarned, ef you kin
run her I don't mind ef you go out any old time.
But I'd like ter see ef you kin, afore we go any
further."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where is she?"</p>

<p>"Right out there. I'll row you out to her.
Come on down this ladder; easy, now. You're
pretty old for this sort of work."</p>

<p>But, despite the old man's apparent decrepitude,
he stepped down the steep and rather rickety
ladder, at the foot of which lay a dory, with
the agility of a youth. His companion declared
that he would remain on the dock.</p>

<p>Guessing that he didn't want to leave the bag,
of which he seemed so careful, Lem hailed him.</p>

<p>"Come on and bring your grip, ef ye scared o'
leavin' it," he said.</p>

<p>But the other shook his head, and Lem pulled
out toward his launch with only the old man as
passenger. The launch was a black, rakish-looking
craft, and once on board the old man expressed
approval of the powerful, two-cylindered
engine with which she was equipped.</p>

<p>"Say, you do know suthin' about ingines, don't
yer?" admired Lem, after a few sharp questions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
had shown him that the queer old man really
knew what he was talking about.</p>

<p>A muttered grunt was the only reply. The
old man was spinning the fly-wheel over, after
making a few adjustments of the gasoline and
spark supply. A moment later the motor was
sputtering and coughing, and the launch was
struggling at her moorings.</p>

<p>Lem cast off and ran the craft about the harbor
for a while. At the conclusion of the test
he was satisfied that the old man actually did understand
the workings of gasoline motors. Returning
to the wharf, it only remained for a
bargain to be struck, and this was speedily done.
But Lem still held out for something more.</p>

<p>"Seein' as I don't know you an' you're takin'
ther boat out alone, I ought ter hev a deposit or
suthin'," he declared, his eyes narrowing.</p>

<p>"What's your boat worth?" demanded the old
man.</p>

<p>"Wa'al, I paid a thousand fer her," rejoined<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
Lem, who had only doubled the actual sum the
launch cost him.</p>

<p>"Here you are."</p>

<p>The old man reached into a recess of his black
coat and produced a roll of currency, which Lem
later declared to his cronies would have "choked
a horse." Rapidly peeling off several bills of
large denomination, he paid the exorbitant deposit,
plus the price agreed upon for the hire
of the boat for the night. Lem, too astonished
to do more than stutter, pocketed the money without
a word.</p>

<p>"One thing more," said the old man; "we shall
need a small boat to tow along."</p>

<p>"Oh, then yer goin' ter land some place?"</p>

<p>Lem, having recovered the use of his voice,
had also regained his rural curiosity.</p>

<p>The old man regarded him angrily, and then,
in his peculiar, snarling voice, he whipped out:</p>

<p>"What's that to you? We've paid you too
much for your boat, and you know it. Here's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
fifty dollars more. That's not to ask any questions
and not to answer any."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll keep mum," Lem assured him, pocketing
the extra money with sparkling eyes. "When
you're ready to go, I'll have a small boat ready
for you, never fear."</p>

<p>"Good. We'll be here at five o'clock sharp."</p>

<p>The old man and his companion sauntered off
up the street. Lem watched them till they entered
the Bellport Hotel. Then, to himself, he
exclaimed in tones that fairly burst out of him:</p>

<p>"Wa'al, what d'ye know about that? Them
chaps is either lunatics or millionaires, or both.
Wa'al, it's none of my affair, an' there might be
things I wouldn't do for fifty dollars, but keepin'
my mouth shut for a while ain't one of 'em.
What a yarn I'll have ter tell when them two
chaps gets out of town! Kain't get over thet
old feller, though. Fer all his years, he's spry as
a boy; suthin' mighty funny about both on 'em."</p>

<p>With this, Lem resumed his seat on the edge<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
of the wharf and dismissed the matter from his
mind as far as was possibly consistent with the
knowledge of the&mdash;to him&mdash;gigantic sum reposing
in his blue jeans.</p>

<p>Yet, had he known it, he was letting slip
through his fingers the possibility of earning a
far larger sum. For the man with the queer eyes
was Ivan Karloff, a notorious anarchist, for
whom a reward of five thousand dollars was offered,
following a bomb outrage in New York,
and his companion was Berghoff himself.</p>

<p>What were these two men doing in Bellport?
Why did they want a fast boat for a mysterious
night trip?</p>

<p>The answers to these questions would have
held a burning interest for our friends on the
submarine island. Like a vicious snake, Berghoff
was preparing to strike what he hoped would
be a vital blow at the <i>Peacemaker</i> and her guardians.
Crafty and unscrupulous, he had invested
in his services Ivan Karloff, whose price for dangerous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
undertakings was high, but whose skill in
his nefarious line of endeavor was supreme.</p>

<p>It was about midnight when Lem Higgins'
motor boat crept up to a spot not far from
where the <i>Peacemaker</i> lay at anchor. Behind
her she towed the promised small boat. Berghoff,
as we must now call the old man, was at
the engines. His companion was steering.</p>

<p>"Is this near enough?" inquired Karloff, in a
low tone, as Berghoff slowed up the engines.</p>

<p>"Yes. We want to run no chances. It would
not be pleasant for either of us to be nipped
now."</p>

<p>No more words were exchanged till the anchor
was noiselessly let drop.</p>

<p>Then Berghoff spoke.</p>

<p>"Have you got everything?"</p>

<p>"Yes; it's all in the bag&mdash;the wire, the batteries,
and all. Wonder what those farmers
would have done if they could have guessed what
else we had in there?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>"Gone through the ceiling, I reckon," chuckled
Berghoff grimly; "but come on, let's get to work.
We may have a long job to find the submarine."</p>

<p>"Yes, and we've no time to lose. After the
job's done the quicker we put the Atlantic between
us and Uncle Sam, the better," was the
reply.</p>

<p>"You're not nervous, are you?"</p>

<p>"Nervous! My friend, I have done more dangerous
jobs than this."</p>

<p>Depositing the bag carefully in the small boat,
the two men rowed off. They made absolutely
no noise as they proceeded, the reason for this
being that the oars had been carefully muffled
soon after they left Bellport, and felt free from
observation.</p>

<p>After ten minutes or so of rowing, Berghoff
laid a hand on his companion's arm.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Karloff, who was rowing.</p>

<p>"Look right ahead. What's that?"</p>

<p>"The glow of a light. Can that be it?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>"It must be. That light is reflected from the
conning tower. There is somebody on board."</p>

<p>"That matters not, if they are not on deck.
Even so, we can take care of them."</p>

<p>"You mean to hurl it?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but I'd rather fasten it to the craft itself.
It's safer for us and more effective."</p>

<p>A diabolical grin stole over the anarchist's face
as he spoke. He resumed his cautious rowing.</p>

<p>"There's no one on deck," declared Berghoff,
as they crept closer to the dark outlines of the
anchored submarine.</p>

<p>"Good; then we can do our work quickly.
Have you everything ready?"</p>

<p>"Yes; we'll be alongside in a minute. Don't
make a failure of it."</p>

<p>"I have never failed yet," was the quiet reply,
spoken in a voice so menacing and evil that it
would have caused a shudder to run through any
one less hardened than the man to whom it was
addressed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>Rob flashed to the surface after a longer interval
than Merritt would have believed it possible
for anybody to remain submerged. As he appeared,
Merritt rushed to aid him upon the slippery
deck of the <i>Peacemaker</i>.</p>

<p>Rob shook his head, as Merritt tried to draw
him up. Instead, he choked out:</p>

<p>"A pair of pliers. Quick! Our lives depend
upon it."</p>

<p>Merritt, who had been working on the engine,
happened to have the required tool in his pocket.
Without a word, he handed it to Rob. From
his leader's manner he knew that down there
under the water the boy had discovered some
deadly hidden peril. Breathlessly, he watched
for his reappearance, for the instant he received
the pliers Rob had dived.</p>

<div class='center'><b>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</b></div>

<p>In the rowboat which they had towed out from
Bellport, Berghoff and his companion sat bending
over some object. Had it been daylight it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
could have been seen that this object was a battery
box.</p>

<p>Also, daylight would have revealed Berghoff's
face as being white and drawn under his disguise;
but his companion's evil countenance
never changed an iota, as his long fingers sought
and found the button of the battery box which
lay before him on a thwart.</p>

<p>From this box two wires led off into the darkness.
When the button was pressed a flash of
electricity would pass through those wires and
the climax of a fiendishly ingenious plot would
be reached. In the tense silence that preceded
the pressing of the button, Berghoff's breath
could be heard coming gaspingly. His companion,
on the other hand, appeared as cool as an
icicle.</p>

<p>"Are you certain we are far enough away?"
stammered Berghoff.</p>

<p>"Absolutely. I have no desire to be hoisted
by my own petard. Now then, if you are ready,
say the word."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;" stammered Berghoff.</p>

<p>"Bah! You are a coward; come, I am all
ready."</p>

<p>"I don't mind the submarine, curse it; but it's
the thought of the lives on board her."</p>

<p>"My friend, you are too sensitive. Come, are
you ready?"</p>

<p>"Ye-es," choked out Berghoff, his teeth chattering,
and the sweat pouring off his face. The
man was shaking like a leaf, and his breath came
raspingly from between his half-opened lips.</p>

<p>"Now!"</p>

<p>He steeled himself to utter the signal firmly,
but it was merely a harsh whisper that issued
from his dry throat.</p>

<p>The long fingers pressed down. Berghoff,
swaying like a stricken thing, placed his hands
before his eyes. But the sound that both had
been expecting did not come. No roaring explosion
followed the pressing of the button, no flash
of livid flame and shattering of the wonderful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
structure of steel they had hoped to destroy. A
death-like stillness prevailed.</p>

<p>"You've failed!" choked out Berghoff.</p>

<p>His companion's eyes flashed in the darkness
like a cat's. He swallowed convulsively.</p>

<p>"There is only one explanation," he snarled.</p>

<p>"And that is?"</p>

<p>"That they have discovered the mine. My
friend, we had better be leaving as soon as possible.
It will not be good for us to be found in
this vicinity."</p>

<p>At that very moment two boys were standing
with horror-stricken eyes on the deck of the submarine.
In his hands Rob held a peculiar looking
cylinder of steel. From one end of it hung
two severed wires. It was so weighted and
balanced as to float a distance of about five feet
under the surface of the water.</p>

<p>"If I hadn't found those wires and cut them,"
Rob said, in an awe-stricken voice.</p>

<p>But Merritt did not answer. He could only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
clasp his companion's hand. The realization of
the fearfully narrow limit by which they had
escaped death almost overcame him. The night
was hot, but both boys shivered as if stricken
with the ague. It was some minutes before they
could give the alarm to those on shore. Then the
rapid blowing of the whistle used by the submarine
when on the surface signalled their companions.</p>

<p>Some fifteen minutes later two pale-faced,
wild-eyed lads were explaining to an absorbed
group the foiling of the diabolical plot against
Uncle Sam's diving boat. It was not long after,
that the submarine was rushing through the
water for the nearest harbor.</p>

<p>"If we can arouse the police along the coast
we may yet be able to capture the authors of this
outrage," exclaimed the ensign, as at full speed
the <i>Peacemaker</i> clove through the waters.</p>

<p>"Yes; it's hardly probable that they had as
swift a boat as this," agreed Mr. Barr. "If we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
can get ashore ahead of them, we can cause a
police net to be spread that they can scarcely
break through."</p>

<p>But it was decreed that the fate of Berghoff
and his companion should be a different one.
Suddenly, off to port of the <i>Peacemaker</i>, the
night was split by a roar and a red flash of
flame.</p>

<p>"Great Scott! What was that?" gasped out
Ensign Hargreaves.</p>

<p>"The searchlight&mdash;quick!" cried Mr. Barr.</p>

<p>In an instant the great beam of white light
was cutting the night like a fiery sword. Suddenly
its rays concentrated on a dark object not
far distant from the <i>Peacemaker</i>.</p>

<p>Within the radiant circle was limned a strange
picture. Two men were struggling in the water,
while beside them the outline of a boat showed
for an instant and then vanished forever.</p>

<p>At top speed the <i>Peacemaker</i> was rushed to
the scene. She reached it in time for those on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
board to see one of the two men struggling in
the water throw up his arms. The next instant,
with a shuddering cry, that might have been
either defiance or agony, he vanished as had the
boat.</p>

<p>The other man was picked up. He was an
old man, seemingly, and almost exhausted from
his struggle with the waves. But, as he was being
dragged on board, a strange thing occurred.
The salt water, with which he was drenched, had
likewise soaked his beard and hair. As he was
hauled over the sloping deck of the submarine
his beard and hair slipped away, and there before
them lay Berghoff, seemingly dead or dying.</p>

<p>As soon as they had recovered from their
amazement, he was carried below and made as
comfortable as possible; for it was found that
he was shockingly burned. The chart was consulted,
and it was reckoned that Bellport was
the closest place at which to land. And so it
came about, that Berghoff&mdash;or the wreck of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
man&mdash;was brought back to the very spot from
which he and his ill-fated companion had set out
on their diabolical trip.</p>

<p>Under close police guard the injured man was
carried to the local hospital, and with his first
conscious breath he cried aloud for Karloff. He
was told of the man's fate, and then made a full
confession of the plot to blow up the submarine.
As for the accident that had destroyed their own
craft, he explained that Karloff, stooping to
light a cigarette, had ignited some leaked gasoline
in the bilge. In a flash the flames had
reached the fuel tank, and an explosion that
ripped the boat apart followed.</p>

<p>For days the man lingered in the hospital,
apparently contrite and suffering great pain.
But one night a drowsy nurse and an open window
aided him in a plan of escape that must
have formed itself in his mind some time before.
In a weak voice he begged his police guard to
get him a drink of water. When the man came<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
back, Berghoff had gone. Nor was he ever heard
of again. Whether he managed in some way
to communicate with his friends, or whether he
gained financial resources to aid his escape by
robbery or other means, will never be known.</p>

<p>"Wa'al, I'm glad I stuck to that thousand,"
said Lem Higgins, when he heard of the escape.
"I'll git another boat now."</p>

<div class='center'><b>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</b></div>

<p>And so ends the tale of the Boy Scouts' services
for Uncle Sam. Of course, they remained
on the island till the conclusion of the tests. But
they were molested no more, and so far as they
were concerned Berghoff and his evil designs
ceased to exist. Their experiences had proved of
much value to them, and broadened and developed
their characters to a marked extent.</p>

<p>We shall meet our friends and fellow Scouts
again in a succeeding volume of this series, for
strong, healthy lads like these cannot seem to
help meeting with adventures. When they face<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
them in the true Scout spirit, that of bravery
mixed with brains, it is a combination hard to
beat. This new volume will be called "<span class="smcap">The Boy
Scouts at the Panama Canal</span>," and will relate
their experiences at the "Big Ditch," that remarkable
engineering achievement that is holding
the interest and attention of the entire world.
The book will contain authentic photographs of
the canal in process of construction and include
accurate descriptions of the engineering feats.</p>
